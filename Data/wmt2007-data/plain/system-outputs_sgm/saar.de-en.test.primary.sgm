<SEG id="1"> Our Charter of fundamental rights is the first in this one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2"> We must succeed in the Union in such a way as to ensure that we have the countries which, under the appropriate conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="3"> In Article 87 of the scope for social, cultural and must be included, so that these institutions are also important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="4"> Some are of the opinion that one can create an internal market in Europe, without on fundamental values and principles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="5"> I would also like to emphasise the clear and substantial contribution of President Prodi. </SEG> 
<SEG id="6"> As you know, one made in Amsterdam, for these two functions clearly decided to separate the high representative - in contrast to the Commission - not, but its task consists in the coordination of the foreign and security policies, the responsibility of the Member States, and here we certainly a larger place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="7"> He has expressed the wish that the Presidency in Nice which shows. </SEG> 
<SEG id="8"> It is in fact a more comprehensive and better result, but I am of the opinion that we have made a good start. </SEG> 
<SEG id="9"> Therefore, I hope that the European Council in Nice, this project, and it is incomprehensible as project, not as a fait accompli, on the way to bring the necessary reforms now having been decided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="10"> I have, however, also, I pointed out that we in the current is extremely important objectives with the Community method can reach, such as, for example, now a more effective action in the Balkans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="11"> Only if we Russia at the request and on the European Union, we will be able to influence to take on its policies and in contact with Russia, and in the sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="12"> (00 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs for the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="13"> It continues this Europe of the media and the rule of law in Russia, which hardly exist anyway, completely removed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="14"> In the effort, the expectations of this Giuseppe Italia, and would like to be with the ship, which would, I have voted for the report, which concerns the development and the development of ports as well as the intermodal terminals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="15"> By the result of the vote of the objective of the directive, which of all the speakers and the Commission recognised and was. </SEG> 
<SEG id="16"> Mr President, I have, as I said during the debate, before the vote, which I have voted for the report by Mr Skinner, because I regard as very important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="17"> My parliamentary Group colleague yesterday, of course, clear that only a small point out, insurance cover to operate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="18"> Therefore, the sooner the current, even in the nation-states to confirm that it represents a real progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="19"> Mr President, at last we have a Charter of fundamental rights of the Union on the table, in which a whole Article, namely Article 25, the older relations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="20"> But if he obligation and in the contract, as the European Parliament demands it inevitably with the time to a standardization of the national right of the individual European countries. it would cause the Court a relatively large power that the centralisation around the European institutions and the independent of each other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="21"> · a Charter put down and that the subordinate right reservations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="22"> I will vote for it, as I myself at the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz and in Nice on 7 December 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="23"> Progress of the 12 candidate countries on the path towards accession </SEG> 
<SEG id="24"> I think that a number of Member States still have not yet understood that there is this context and that the progress of the IGC in great difficulties can bring the debates in the necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="25"> All this about all this, we will, in the long term, only through, if, in the candidate countries, and also in the European Union policy and the policy - and in this limited context, you are quite right, Mr Commissioner, I agree with you for it, that the enlargement of the European Union, for they are of use. </SEG> 
<SEG id="26"> This is the principle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="27"> Let me now come to the second objective, with the Presidency in this in the process going. </SEG> 
<SEG id="28"> I therefore suggest that you, in this direction, with the idea that we work in regard to 2003, which candidates are ready to join us, to this date. </SEG> 
<SEG id="29"> I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee for foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his comprehensive and clear report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="30"> It does not in any way in the negotiations about the 'if', it is just about the 'how' and 'when'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="31"> But they have also done so, because the prospect of membership in the European Union which, on the solidarity of the European peoples, and as you so firm political and economic is required. </SEG> 
<SEG id="32"> A number of countries are also in the second criterion, and on the internal market as well advanced that they maturity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="33"> We therefore seek the coordination with the national governments, of Parliament and other institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="34"> Annual - and this will, on 8 November, to be the case - will in each of the applicant countries with very great tension the judgement of the Commission on the progress that has been made of them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="35"> Rightly we have for the principle of differentiation, and its progress and to its progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="36"> This debate is a further opportunity for my Group, to confirm that the accession of the Central and East European countries, but also of Cyprus and Malta, the best for us all in Europe in the East and in the West. </SEG> 
<SEG id="37"> This is a matter of importance, but in the public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="38"> Many mean that after the fall of the Berlin wall, the wall has always stayed the same: five years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="39"> The offers in connection with the subsequent elections to the European Parliament in the year 2009, but we want that to many countries that already clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="40"> In substance, it did aspects to which we aspects. </SEG> 
<SEG id="41"> In reality, it is the model of the European unification, i.e. the simultaneous in all sectors of the traditions and characteristics of the participants in this impasse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="42"> "in Central and Eastern Europe in the end to lend represents for us all up to the present day, an obligation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="43"> But for the very clear: there can be no tariff. </SEG> 
<SEG id="44"> It is a great and simultaneously, the idea that we are not against the distinguished and that the best way in which the agreement with the changes in its participation in the elections is, for the elections are an expression of democracy and a form of the involvement of the citizens in the political system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="45"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment briefly on the conditions for a scenario that here by several sides. </SEG> 
<SEG id="46"> I would be very surprised if they make no pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="47"> But I had already pointed out that all the countries of the maturity relatively quickly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="48"> That is the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural produce, without ensuring that the human rights and that therefore the breaks down. </SEG> 
<SEG id="49"> It has also already, but in the whole of peace and the food and education is brought into this development continues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="50"> The negotiation should be decisive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="51"> The only proposal was submitted, is already contained in my report, but I am happy that the Group of the Greens, the importance of the equal treatment of citizens and businesses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="52"> In addition, not only a law, but also that it is for the public, and a fair payment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="53"> This applies to both for Latvia as well as for the European Union! </SEG> 
<SEG id="54"> The involvement of the planned at the euro in the second half of the year 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="55"> (ES) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Poland, for which I am the rapporteur, is the largest and most important, but, as we know, also one of the countries on the accession to the European Union people; it shows such problems, that over a Poland from the first Group, i.e. the first Group of accession countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="56"> How have Poland and the former Communist countries too many promises, given that we have held. </SEG> 
<SEG id="57"> There is a point which, if it goes to the Czech Republic, is the issue of the export of the Roma. </SEG> 
<SEG id="58"> Slovakia was not in the second Group consistently referred to, and would like to join with the Czech Republic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="59"> In conclusion, I would like, nor a single point of domestic policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="60"> Thirdly, as regards agriculture, whose still under which the European Union is, so it will be necessary, for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and the proposals to increase the capital. </SEG> 
<SEG id="61"> Bulgaria is very much at an accession to the European Union and NATO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="62"> The acute poverty is one of the most serious problems, but, under the current government, that the economic situation is, in fact, take a turn for the better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="63"> These issues are important priorities of itself in 14 days constituting new Parliament and the government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="64"> At the same time, however, to underline that a just and lasting solution to both the resolutions of the UN security Council, in other words, nothing other than the valid, as well as the European Union is the underlying principles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="65"> In addition, functioning democratic institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="66"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee for the economy, and also our part to contribute to this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="67"> They must also be carried out of the European Community is just not only in the books, but also in the applicant countries a law in action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="68"> This puts the requirements for the people in the applicant countries, but also for their future and the future of their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="69"> Special attention - and since I myself the speakers - is on the border regions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="70"> In this context, the Commission must not be left! </SEG> 
<SEG id="71"> The candidate countries for a rapid growth, even if this is at the expense of an already agreed environmental concerns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="72"> It was a bad habits, as well as in the area of health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="73"> Mr President, enlargement is indispensable for the construction of a strong and United European continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="74"> The European Parliament and its Committee for regional policy, also for the area of traffic and the European networks, are aware of the need, the various sectoral policies in favour of a global room to coordinate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="75"> Previously, but still a reference to the fact that the infrastructure of Central importance for the success of enlargement will be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="76"> Mr President, I myself which, in the forthcoming enlargement, the task of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="77"> In the former planned in Central and Eastern Europe on the traditional social values pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="78"> The Group of the European people's Party would like to the responsibility for the candidate countries and the candidate countries, because we no date. </SEG> 
<SEG id="79"> The second point is the designation of data. </SEG> 
<SEG id="80"> There is another reason. </SEG> 
<SEG id="81"> Thirdly: the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole - that has shown - the Commission, the reforms and deficits and dismantled. </SEG> 
<SEG id="82"> Is the term, with the people, when he expresses itself in a manner which does not fit them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="83"> Ladies and gentlemen, you have recess, it will continue at 9 p.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="84"> It is, albeit in the long term, a common currency for the entire continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="85"> "over these internal conflicts in the individual countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="86"> We call on you to fight for a different Europe, a Europe of all the peoples of these their peoples, in which all peoples to determine their own fate and among friends of peace, freedom, and the means to produce mutual benefit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="87"> I would like the work of these organisations, this publicly, above all, as well as its seat in Birmingham, many people from Ireland, which many people are also of the Irish doing a donation in the amount of 1 million pounds and this sum in Ireland and other parts of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="88"> The Summit in Nice must, above all, clarity and whether and how the EU can finance in the situation, comprehensively and timely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="89"> The measure ask themselves: they then, if we are also joined us paid, or we are second class? </SEG> 
<SEG id="90"> I am sure that, with good will and with the help of the European Union a solution can be found, the two communities in prosperity and a life in peace, so long as this has been the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="91"> We have, but also about the question of the minority, as the question of the integration of these minorities, integration, integration in these countries also of importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="92"> The conditions for membership is actually the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="93"> We have much over the expansion, but this is an area in which we can learn of Lithuania. </SEG> 
<SEG id="94"> Imagine, we are all so! </SEG> 
<SEG id="95"> Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, Mr Brok and the rapporteurs and thank you, but I would like to focus in particular on the minority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="96"> I call on you, in Nice, to specify a date when it with the most advanced candidate countries - without designation - to conclude the negotiations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="97"> The European Union must keep on his way to entry into the Union help and cause the planning of this aid nor decentralized. </SEG> 
<SEG id="98"> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and the Parliament plays a vital and - as we realise - positive role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="99"> We are just going to the division of Europe and not to create new ones. </SEG> 
<SEG id="100"> All of this is in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, and I would like to thank her on behalf of our Group very sincerely for this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="101"> According to this aid is, in my opinion, the subject and that is on the ability of Europe without the citizens will judge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="102"> I myself live near the sea, which is a common concern for us all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="103"> The political vision remains. </SEG> 
<SEG id="104"> So we have taken the desire of Klaus Hänsch, knowledge, for the PSE Group that the Commission has a real evaluation of the effects of enlargement and the economic consequences, if it is not to enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="105"> Nevertheless, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, that it is in the interest of both parties will not go, and just as Members of a border region, which, as Mrs Schierhuber a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border, that it is a concern that developing a common without problems can be a positive result on both sides. </SEG> 
<SEG id="106"> Three points, as a social Democrat, I want to underline. </SEG> 
<SEG id="107"> The questions of the first pillar of the economy in the applicant countries access to the internal market, and does not, and the EU, on the other hand, but not yet to change these countries not starting from the positive impulses, especially for the economy in the applicant countries - they need not only to their company for the Mediterranean, to do - as well as for the economy in the EU if the costs of the debates on the European population even two, in the ewr-modell would have been even more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="108"> Secondly: they leave the big idea, in many of the candidate countries at the same time, this would contradict the principle of each country according to its progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="109"> Thirdly: we must do everything to wish the European Union in the sense of the speech of President Prodi on the enlargement process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="110"> In this connection I want Parliament to address the Council with the evidence, that it has been considerable delays in the reply to written questions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="111"> It is correct that this is happening in a country which wants to join the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="112"> I apply in the Committee, in which the necessary steps should be prepared. </SEG> 
<SEG id="113"> Mr President, today we are all three reports on this subject, including two points, and perhaps decide about that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="114"> That would at all stages of the food chain affect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="115"> Safe food mean in the entire chain of costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="116"> We must therefore Mrs Paulsen and the Commission, and not for the animal feed and the European consumers are protected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="117"> The 1999 directive was well thought out, and you can also now already a success, charges are reduced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="118"> But a solution that is not the solution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="119"> Very briefly, we must, on the amendments to the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="120"> On this point, we are of the opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="121"> The result will be that we, as European consumers for meat, milk and whose buy on the State of the Union from the 1994 and limit the appropriate feed to be produced, in other words, in a system in which less on the acquired, where each material or any preparation mixed unhindered, before the other in the territory of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="122"> Before the second reading, the Commission should inform us about the planned procedures at risk. </SEG> 
<SEG id="123"> However, it would be extremely serious if, for example, the proposals adopted 39 and 40, because it is for the Member States, no more, with new dangers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="124"> Consumer protection already in feed, in materials and, Finally, the official controls. </SEG> 
<SEG id="125"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen to the materials in food concerns an important topic, which is an extremely important issues in a highly disputed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="126"> The discussion about the report by Mrs Paulsen, before us today was in some points after the current, and following the current discussion, we can assume that for the changed conditions, the quality of through additions however. </SEG> 
<SEG id="127"> Each of these three proposals, both individually and in common with the removal of the dioxin crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="128"> With the proposal and should be prevented, the requirements of this directive is not in the export be prevented. </SEG> 
<SEG id="129"> The Commission rejects the proposals, 41, 42, 43 and 44, which proposed the products under certain conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="130"> This should be our promise that we face in the context of the new proposal on the establishment of a system for the rapid exchange of information media, which will cover the entire food and feedingstuffs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="131"> Commissioner Byrne, with this directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs that is in fact our old problem, namely the question of the open declaration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="132"> And it is for me to have the benefit of this morning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="133"> Because if we do that, if we are here or transfer and also quickly through the procedure, is certainly a large profit, and I am sure that the Council with the very strong and United. </SEG> 
<SEG id="134"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, also in future it may not occur, but at least it is not contaminated feed materials in food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="135"> The scandal was the worst example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="136"> As our rapporteur has already said, it would be best if we label with open declaration, to which the ingredients are listed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="137"> I think the professional qualification and the Members of the Committee on agriculture and rural development in matters of agriculture and therefore also in question, in the sense of a practical and workable solution of the farmers concerned and are supposed to be used and understood. </SEG> 
<SEG id="138"> So far, the positive part. </SEG> 
<SEG id="139"> I consider this to be a legitimate right to information, which we must take into account. </SEG> 
<SEG id="140"> On behalf of my colleagues from the Committee on fisheries and in my own name, I call on you, Madam President, the Member of the victims and the local authorities, as well as of Brittany, Galicia, where most of the victims, the interest of Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="141"> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="142"> - like against the model? </SEG> 
<SEG id="143"> So the rapporteur is the situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="144"> Most of the technical proposals deserve our firm support, as for example in the area of food safety, the closure of the nuclear power stations of the first generation, environmental protection, combating AIDS, the code of conduct for in the East and in the West and much more of jobs are enormous and therefore absolutely priority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="145"> At the same time also a considerable difficulties to overcome, especially in the area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="146"> An extension to 13 countries, not only the geopolitical context of the European Union, but also its structure, since on the one hand the Commission will increase the total 20%), but also, on the other hand, the number of "and not". </SEG> 
<SEG id="147"> It is important to note that in the countries a competitive and based on its high economic and social weight for the successful and restructuring will be of crucial importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="148"> In this connection, I would like to express the wish that the outermost regions, of which six of the seven still more to the EU's, not only due to the structural funds alone, but also on the basis of geographical, demographic and, above all, social indicators. </SEG> 
<SEG id="149"> Because we reject this Europe in the interest, we its extension to the countries and peoples of the West, just recently by the Communist dictatorship are released and not yet know in what technocratic and step with this step, not with a clear conscience. </SEG> 
<SEG id="150"> We had with the countries in a short but at most. </SEG> 
<SEG id="151"> The system of subsidies, subsidies and quotas must through free trade and adapting to the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="152"> The importance and significance of the problems that enlargement entails not with the system in the European Union itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="153"> Over the extension to speak for me that some countries to Europe or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="154"> Our country has changed during the last ten years for the basic criteria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="155"> Latvia has its place in this House, not only because it all its progress regarding the right of these "confidence" for a successful conclusion of such negotiations, but, above all, and first and foremost because it at home in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="156"> In my view, the State of all the applicant countries on our support and our commitment, for without the extremely important initiatives of Poland, and not to be the case, and we were not here today, in order to deal with this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="157"> For the Polish consists, possibly in the same way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="158"> I would appeal to Prague, this sign this request, this request for dialogue to take and to comply with this House to ensure that these to a nationalistic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="159"> (en) I welcome the report by Mr Wiersma on the application of the means to accession to the European Union, and the largest part of its conclusions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="160"> With this opportunity, on this occasion the older and the fact that the Republic of Bulgaria y Marfil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="161"> If further progress, and the European Union their institutional structures and policies adapted to the expansion and I see no reason why should not be included in the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="162"> The position is clearly to Ireland, as well as a solution for the problem of which is just as for both sides is extremely difficult. </SEG> 
<SEG id="163"> Unfortunately, some of the statements in the report of the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy on the application by the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union, not just in the 1960s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="164"> In view of the lack of good will and for Turkey, this will not be an easy task. </SEG> 
<SEG id="165"> Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="166"> I was at one, even though, when I, in the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="167"> For all these reasons, I have voted for the proposed by the European Commission agreed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="168"> We must in this request to put pressure on the military regime in Burma, democracy is restored. </SEG> 
<SEG id="169"> We are not consistent in our approach and in the implementation of our measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="170"> Now is not the time for small and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="171"> Some important points in the regulation are Firstly: all of the burden of proof. </SEG> 
<SEG id="172"> Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="173"> "the therefore understand, from which we have legal regulations to combat discrimination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="174"> Also on the basis of which we are now facing numerous proposals by the same level of protection against discrimination for reasons of race, on the one hand, and for reasons of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, on the other hand, is to be ensured. </SEG> 
<SEG id="175"> He had to try, prudence and a good, and his report, in my opinion, these qualities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="176"> Moreover, these Members of the view that the discrimination is not so that specific legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="177"> The financial resources of the action programme is not enough, in order to replace the work performed and hopefully also in other programs, and it is our duty to ensure that over the years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="178"> Over the need to combat discrimination, there is general agreement on the means and the resources to go with the divergent opinions, however. </SEG> 
<SEG id="179"> In Committee, I had the opportunity to defend themselves against, and one that also to come in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="180"> Just as we welcome in is the same for people with disabilities, which also means that appropriate adjustments in the workplace, given by the companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="181"> Only in this way can we manage, discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe effectively. </SEG> 
<SEG id="182"> All in all, the us also racism and discrimination that racism and discrimination, with the help of the Liberal democracy, and not by the and the freedom of expression, the freedom of expression of opinion, freedom of association and the economic freedoms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="183"> In a proposal, the comparison with the family. </SEG> 
<SEG id="184"> In this way, the European Union, in which it about the discrimination or the treatment of its citizens, an unambiguous stance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="185"> I would like, on the question of the exception in terms of religion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="186"> From various sides were reservations about the interpretation of Article 1, which is still somewhat unclear in the sexual behaviour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="187"> In this way, a hierarchy of discrimination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="188"> In one comes on the advantages in the rates of benefits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="189"> Together with the recently adopted directive 2000, this adjustment to the will of the European Union, for an open society, stand by and, above all, of the in European history, the stigma of racism is free. </SEG> 
<SEG id="190"> That therefore, here, in this Parliament, the values which we all want to defend, not in a European Union policy to be mistaken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="191"> This is acquired there may not be touched. </SEG> 
<SEG id="192"> Finally, the media, is also an important role in this task. </SEG> 
<SEG id="193"> The experience has also shown that the legislative proposals for combating discrimination, but is not enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="194"> We must have a disorder throughout Europe solely on a purely politically correct Community without deeper sense would be reduced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="195"> This Parliament has, in my view, the legal, which the European Commission wanted to propose a tree. </SEG> 
<SEG id="196"> Let me first of all to the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for two excellent reports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="197"> I can accept your proposals, through which both the importance of the fight against discrimination should be underlined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="198"> The second point, the text of the proposal of the Commission, during the third category of numerous Treaties with which this proposal is in line with the in June last year 2000 directive against racial discrimination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="199"> In particular, the 9, 10 and 20, the reference to the discrimination based on race and ethnic origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="200"> I can their references in the 'on 2 and natural and legal persons groups of persons, not only because this proposal on the employment only for individuals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="201"> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="202"> We no public support for expect, if our troops are threatened with the weapons we have delivered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="203"> In my homeland, I even once a shotgun, while I voted for the approval in permission. </SEG>

<SEG id="241"> I can assure you that these elections are democratic and better implemented in our countries in our countries, at which I was present or with which I was present as an observer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="242"> However, we saw him as the beginning and the end of the process. </SEG>

<SEG id="246"> The regulation, with which these activities of one and the same head, should be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="247"> These bodies must indeed to have an internal use, it would be quite certain, however, certain minimum standards with regard to the test for the Council to do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="248"> This proposal, as the Commissioner knows very well, in Parliament, not on unanimous approval. </SEG> 
<SEG id="249"> Therefore - nothing against an internal audit service, for which we are today, with the report by Mr van Hulten light! </SEG> 
<SEG id="250"> Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="251"> We are of the opinion that the administration is urgently needed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="252"> A test is indispensable in order to avoid mistakes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="253"> The money should be specific and effectively spent, and should also be better, that the resources for the purposes for which they were determined by the budgetary authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="254"> Now to the proposed amendments: the following: the introduction of this agrees to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="255"> I would like to thank you for your suggestions and your consultation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="256"> I would like the proposals of this report, which I think are most important and most effective summarize: first, a Group of experts from the Member States of the high-level in order to contribute to the establishment of the generally acknowledged parameters for the protection of persons in the media; Secondly: it is to by all TV; Thirdly, and access to the both for the television and the Internet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="257"> Unfortunately, I cannot agree. </SEG> 
<SEG id="258"> It is and remains the responsibility of the legislation, not on certain in dialogue with all the parties involved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="259"> Under the given conditions, in my view, it is the responsibility of the parents, their children at home to preserve this type of programmes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="260"> If, in this area, especially dependent on aid, which must include the following: parameters for the protection of the media in the media in the entire area of the European Union, and of the legislation on the protection of the media and the responsibility of media companies and operators in the sector and in the public sphere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="261"> If, during the debates some say that there is no evidence for the negative impact of the different forms of violence on television on children, then I am astonished and consider this to be an embarrassing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="262"> Regarding the introduction to is, above all, in technical terms, it should be noted that in some Member States already have a television, the parents should enable the television. </SEG> 
<SEG id="263"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="264"> Above all, in my report that the decision-making power by the authority of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="265"> That would be the least about the area of freedom, which is a fundamental right of every citizen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="266"> There is still out of the year 1996. </SEG> 
<SEG id="267"> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani, for the work they have done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="268"> I commend this report to the House and the adoption of Mr Jonathan Evans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="269"> Our resources, our sole future in a world in which knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="270"> And I still much more; we solve problems with ­ ­ or, but by means of concrete measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="271"> But this Parliament has its function and pressure, so that the obstacles still be included in the text. </SEG> 
<SEG id="272"> Today's visit to a time for the future of European unification of great importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="273"> We know, however, that this process is not yet complete and therefore danger to lose its. </SEG> 
<SEG id="274"> If we do not now, in this difficult and manage the European and world history, when we will manage it? </SEG> 
<SEG id="275"> None of us can now claim to know exactly when and in what order we will reach these goals, but we all agree about that in that, if we believe in it and that we already have the distance behind us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="276"> It must be carried out for ensuring that women in employment, which are not as well as in the sectors appear, i.e. less qualified jobs, part-time work on employment, wages and difficult access to positions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="277"> Will the Council with a proposal to the refugees, on the basis of the progress to be assessed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="278"> In short, the fourth pillar, concerning the equal opportunities in support of the integrated approach by the gender mainstreaming and the specific guidelines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="279"> I am thinking in particular of violence against women, is one of the main activity, and I know that this issue is a very special concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="280"> We know that the measures for reconciling family and professional life, especially the women of the present, if there is a lack of studies on the current situation of the family and the role of women in the family and the traditional role, because the company has granted itself and with it the families. </SEG> 
<SEG id="281"> Sometimes seem to some people, including some colleagues in this House, believe that the yet, but that is not true. </SEG> 
<SEG id="282"> Mr President, Let me finish by stressing that the men in the own four walls. </SEG> 
<SEG id="283"> I do not consider such a position for, and should be, in view of the view, because it is not certain that we get to the practical implementation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="284"> In this area there is no equality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="285"> The image of the European, as it out of our report, from which does not correspond to the Romanian women, the reports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="286"> It is my view, and that of the report, in all areas of society, for example on the labour market, must be a balance between men and women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="287"> That is precisely why it is a missed opportunity, that, in this report, marriage and family and respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="288"> That should also be the Committee for women's rights and equal opportunities, better! </SEG> 
<SEG id="289"> We have heard that the previous Presidency, and then. </SEG> 
<SEG id="290"> The Middle working women lies in the average 20% under the men, what that women are the largest part of the poor population and their participation in social and political life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="291"> That is quite excellent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="292"> Throughout the process of the impoverishment of the women in France, where, after 15% of them less than 3% for life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="293"> Not all countries to follow their example, and I hope that the example of France in other countries to contribute. </SEG> 
<SEG id="294"> The history of women is obviously far back. </SEG> 
<SEG id="295"> The candidate must in the acceptance of the acquis communautaire on developing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="296"> However, I need your help. </SEG> 
<SEG id="297"> That is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text, and the Committee on legal Affairs decided after and a discussion, not to produce. </SEG> 
<SEG id="298"> The Committee on legal Affairs reached after long debate to the view that it would not be appropriate, the uncertainty over six years and that the fixed period of three years, more than a reasonable period, with the appropriate resources and an average care to establish whether in a existed or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="299"> That is amendment no 15, in which it is about fraud. </SEG> 
<SEG id="300"> The aim, above all, a simplified, but Nevertheless qualitative communication with sufficient, improvement of the procedures for the recovery and adaptation of the regulations regarding the registration in customs is one of the demands of the single market, and which was achieved, even here, that many countries that have inspire also quickly on trade to participate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="301"> They like to thank Parliament, and in particular the Committee under the Presidency of Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi for the efforts of both institutions for this dossier, and the interest that you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="302"> The resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="303"> I would like that to be influenced by the USA, but the French version really. </SEG> 
<SEG id="304"> Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Evans report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="305"> It is recognised that is a necessary precondition for the mobility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="306"> Moreover, we believe that the Member States be restricted itself on the taxation should decide. </SEG> 
<SEG id="307"> I have a little, that we had no chance, a majority for the need to get a documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="308"> - (FR) in the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we had not the incorporation of Article 13 concerning discrimination for reasons of sex, race, ethnic origin, religion or (not) conviction, disability, age or sexual orientation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="309"> The problems of in these countries is not all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="310"> Out of the grounds for these to the proposal that the Commission will also pursue, against the applicable in the Member States, the relevant provisions which, however, are perfectly are in no meaning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="311"> I consider that, in a new Article 12) compiled. </SEG> 
<SEG id="312"> To justify and and the EPLP welcomes the principle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="313"> (SV) we Christian Democrats welcome in large part to the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for the implementation of the equal treatment in employment and occupation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="314"> But the only says something about the internal an internal audit service, and nothing over the financial importance and so on the benefits of such a service. </SEG> 
<SEG id="315"> The EU has a joint concluded, the so-called outside (and solution outside the territory of the EU), but no own defence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="316"> Without weapons, the world of safer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="317"> The aim is not a drastic reduction in the armament and a policy of but of regulations for the further gains. </SEG> 
<SEG id="318"> In its communication, the Commission recognizes, namely the problem, no concrete measures, because they thought the liberalisation of the market and of competition, the market and its proposals go in exactly at the - especially for children, the payments for the multinational companies which, in which it, and that is what parents and products and their responsibility in order, the children of their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="319"> As the rapporteur, so I am also of the opinion that the measures for the protection of young people above and programmes and on the television, but the media. </SEG> 
<SEG id="320"> With an average of three hours of television, alongside the sleep - for the work - work - the most human activity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="321"> In addition, the women occupy "," jobs; wages women are the sectors in which mainly women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="322"> They are the first victims of the means, the restriction of the right, the right to health care and medical treatment - in the plan, nor in the right on prevention and information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="323"> B5-0792 / 2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Group of the United European left / Nordic Green left, on the crisis in Peru. </SEG> 
<SEG id="324"> Mr President, I would actually would wish, once again, not only in connection with one or other of the urgency, but for a well prepared discussion in a debate about Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="325"> We must do everything to do with ten candidates, so that the objective of the challenge and are in a position to demand of the Peruvian people towards political renewal and democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="326"> The joint debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="327"> Now, we know, Afghanistan is not far away, Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, so that we can imagine what the role of these political - the way not only political - mafias in the expansion of the drug trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="328"> The Commission is a balance of the humanitarian aid so that nobody is forgotten. </SEG> 
<SEG id="329"> This conflict entails. </SEG> 
<SEG id="330"> For years, there is a line, in the framework of prevention and financed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="331"> Let me at this point to the reference made by Mrs Paciotti, I say that, of course, still today, within the Commission will ask the question, what with the means and should happen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="332"> B5-0794 / 2000 by Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping of a guerilla in negotiations with the Spanish Jesuit in Colombia; </SEG> 
<SEG id="333"> We all regret this and would not again to talk about Colombia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="334"> The Commission has already offered a package of measures to coordinate the Commission proposes in the next few days, considerable resources for this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="335"> Once again, therefore, with two, which I consider to be unfortunate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="336"> Especially, the behaviour of the Albanian opposition you made here, but a necessary one Albanian problem in Macedonia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="337"> I consider it to be an extraordinary achievement of the Macedonians, within their country committed to come together. </SEG> 
<SEG id="338"> That is why I also believe that these can be legally, but the government, with large for a solution for the and many other questions, visible signs of success and needs assessment, otherwise the peace in the whole region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="339"> In the context of the national programme for the year 2000 means can also to support in 2001 and, therefore, be used in 2001 and 2002. </SEG> 
<SEG id="340"> I must stress that today already all Greek Members in the European Parliament on this issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="341"> In all these issues, namely Greece, the concern over the largest shipping in the European Union, it is basically the security of every kind of shipping in the entire Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="342"> In recent years, in which far more people lost their lives, not only by the large, but all too often in our communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="343"> On the contrary, innocent victims must stop now, so that the objectives in the broadest sense of the term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="344"> We must be clear about this, that it is also about the credibility of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="345"> I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of the European legislation on the safety of passenger ships is a matter of priority in the European Union, and that it is important to ensure that this legislation in the entire Community harsh and uniformly applied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="346"> I apologise for reasons which you are sufficiently known, something I would like a brief explanation on the two items on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, as well as the situation in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="347"> Commissioner Verheugen, as Mr Solana to the two subjects to speak this afternoon on our agenda, namely, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="348"> We must be prepared to keep the will of the people is respected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="349"> Madam President, Mr high representative, Commissioner, I join me in this debate is not entirely without reservations; I did not, namely that our Parliament in view of the dramatic consequences of the new act in the Middle East, just one month after the here in this Chamber so confidently expectations, today not exclusively, of violence in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="350"> Madam President, my current contribution is based not on all kinds of analyses, but on my own experiences of the past week, because I was in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, to the violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="351"> As an opponent of the violence of the Israelis, and not on the same level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="352"> I would like in this Parliament, a solidarity with the brave people to adopt today in the streets - that the same - that we got a few years the people of other, also for their freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="353"> The Europeans without doubt well advised, the us here in this House by the President of the Palestinian legislative to seize the opportunity offered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="354"> The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="355"> For years, it is managed, with its machine and with brutal pressure on the media, the people in his country, but also, unfortunately, many in the Western world, you a false picture of the reality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="356"> Since the Curtain falls to us, it is the duty of this Parliament as a symbol of a United, free Europe, the measures before the Yugoslav Parliament and Mr Kostuníca at the perception and its mandate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="357"> Precisely this bearing little at the moment - and I have taken these words, I noted before a couple of hours. </SEG> 
<SEG id="358"> I wonder whether the Commissioner in this point already action plans in order to show that we get really as the lawful representatives of the Serbian people and as a partner with whom the European Union has to do from today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="359"> The European Parliament would like it in this historic moment, since the and the democracy and the democracy, its solidarity assure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="360"> The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council decision on the decision 2000 / 24 / EC, in view of the extent of the losses of partnership for the European investment Bank loans for projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="361"> After the Parliament and in this new political orientation is to be welcomed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="362"> It does a task force, whose objective is, in their competence and technical assistance in the contract. </SEG> 
<SEG id="363"> We must not forget that was until recently the classic example of a failed, in which only some of this whole process this whole process must be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="364"> The contribution in the form of an over EUR 250 million for the period 2000 to 2007 can no doubt and, for indeed, but one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="365"> Therefore, it is not quite right, if in this report of a speech. </SEG> 
<SEG id="366"> As Croatia and the means half a century, for the first time they were Hitler's. </SEG> 
<SEG id="367"> We also question the achievements and the issue was not the discussion on development and development in Belgrade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="368"> If it is true that Milosevic and the will of the people and she has, then, we hope that it up to the normal relations between Serbia and particularly the relations between. </SEG> 
<SEG id="369"> I declare the session on Friday, 6 October 2000, to the session of the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="370"> (the House rose and observed a minute 's silence) </SEG> 
<SEG id="371"> My question is: who is to speak on behalf of the European Parliament to speak to Parliament? </SEG>

<SEG id="373"> The changes that it has clearly a murder, probably in connection with torture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="374"> We have the opportunity, their dream - that in my - not a great piece. </SEG> 
<SEG id="375"> This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other legislation of genetically plants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="376"> It is apparent from a fat in others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="377"> (the sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) </SEG>

<SEG id="379"> The importance of this open coordination does not, this method should at the place of the social legislation, because we in Europe also lay down minimum social rights, health risk to formulate and laws in the context of a European market that are required. </SEG> 
<SEG id="380"> We, in our opinion, Moreover, for the dialogue and cooperation with civil society and above all in the countries on its accession to our European family, because there we must initiate a harmonious development of intervention, which in theory and practice following the example of the rest of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="381"> In the communication from the Commission to the communication of the Commission there is general agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="382"> At this point in my speech, I would like at a seminar on the subject on 4 and 5 December displayed in Biarritz, and that I will pass on. </SEG>

<SEG id="384"> I have heard from some quarters that one following the reading of the report, namely the diagnosis, but not the prescribed prescription. </SEG> 
<SEG id="385"> Technological development and the new organization certainly also for a flexible cooperation, with less, but, but rather on goals and results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="386"> Precisely what, in our view, the old-fashioned views are charged by a liberalized market not expect that it all the best. </SEG> 
<SEG id="387"> The social peace in our country and have confidence in direct. </SEG>

<SEG id="389"> When we talk of a Charter of fundamental rights and the creation of a European Constitution, we may not be short-sighted, but that all necessary that all necessary steps must be taken, even if it needs more time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="390"> Then I would like a lack of initiatives to the new challenges in the participation and in the relations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="391"> Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister of the representation of the social policy agenda. </SEG>

<SEG id="405"> Furthermore, I would point out to Mr Monti, that in the report the wider area should be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="406"> What I have said, not only in the area of energy policy, but it also applies to all other areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="407"> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the good work it with the two reports, in which you give a judgment of the Directorate-General for competition, have done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="408"> I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything in this sense, and there is also no boundless competition and may. </SEG> 
<SEG id="409"> Mr President, nobody denies nowadays - and I also not - that the State AIDS the competition and extent of the inefficiency of the enterprise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="410"> So it was it strange to hear that he has the State AIDS in the period in the period in the Commission itself this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="411"> My statement concerns the as the Commission's report on competition policy, but we do not look back on the past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="412"> In the time available to me, I would like to highlight the following three issues: modernisation of Community competition law in the year 1999 to the enforcement of competition rules and, Finally, the State AIDS. </SEG> 
<SEG id="413"> The Commission is always decided against cartel and against the abuse of a dominant position intervened. </SEG> 
<SEG id="414"> Mr Rapkay, the Commission attaches great importance to the support of your Commission by the European Parliament, and I have the impression that this support that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="415"> This system can either at the request of a Member State or in Article 119 of the Treaty on the European communities, a provision which during the third phase of economic and monetary Union just for the countries with exception for the United Kingdom and Sweden. </SEG> 
<SEG id="416"> In the future, the on the capital market, the only option. </SEG> 
<SEG id="417"> I would therefore ask that the report in its present form the approval of the House tomorrow and that therefore also in the area of the European internal market can be used. </SEG> 
<SEG id="418"> That they now need to be on the development of the regulations and on the scientific and technical progress, above all in the in-vitro-increase have been achieved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="419"> When further on the market, for example the intensive use of pesticides can be reduced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="420"> In conclusion I would like to say that we in the interest of the precautionary principle, to which I have just referred to Article and proposals regrettably not, then, as it should be, too, are of the opinion, therefore, and accordingly of health and for the environment, public health and consumer protection and for their deletion of votes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="421"> Mr President, if you permit, Mr Commissioner, in view of the Committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy, public health concerns the amendment 1. </SEG> 
<SEG id="422"> The only point was whether the decree on the mandate of Mr Le Pen, immediately after its transmission by the French government to Protocol should take or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="423"> I would remind you that this vote until 12.30 p.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="424"> In the area of justice and home Affairs, I am optimistic with regard to a solution for the civil judicial cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="425"> The preparation is fully up to its task of 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="426"> We needed a such stimulating climate, as Mr Moscovici, and also with the Heads of State and government, I have very strong feeling of a common, historic responsibility at a time of European unification notice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="427"> It must only be ensured that we experience in these issues of the qualified majority not behind the spirit or the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="428"> The small countries are not the will of the large countries of the European Union! </SEG> 
<SEG id="429"> I would be grateful if this point clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="430"> It was the presence of President Kostunica a historic event. </SEG> 
<SEG id="431"> Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, it is indeed progress with the cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting has been achieved, but differences still exist with regard to the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="432"> It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="433"> Who is the useful cooperation, not of the freedoms on which a vehicle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="434"> I would also like to interfere less than you - in the internal Affairs of Germany, but I am of the opinion that this standpoint, and by the Commission since, if I am not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="435"> We have an exchange of views with the Member States on this issue, which shows that all the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="436"> This is certainly not the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="437"> Firstly, we have sometimes had the impression that the Conference a certain obsession of the debate between small and large countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="438"> In my view, it is not sufficient to say that to be preserved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="439"> Even after the accession of the current candidate countries, each Member State must retain a or. </SEG> 
<SEG id="440"> The wording of Article 93 is so problematic in view of the fact that, after the first successful wave, as well as, of course, be possible to progress in the direction of qualified majority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="441"> The citizens of these countries, of which brings advantages for the new European Treaty entails. </SEG> 
<SEG id="442"> It would be the size of this crisis, we assume that the fears and anxieties without a precondition for the precondition for a place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="443"> I am also concerned that only the Parliament's demand for democratisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="444"> Nevertheless, but this can be reproached the demand of this challenge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="445"> On the one hand, the decision by the government of Israel, the peace because of the use of force in the eurozone and its efforts on the development of a notstandsregierung with the leaders of the opposition, Mr Sharon to concentrate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="446"> Of course, we have the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostuníca to the President noted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="447"> I commend Mr Barón Crespo, his Italian colleagues but to ask themselves why they in Italy with a Communist Party, the government and the Communist Party, the, for the on the participation of the parliamentary work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="448"> Here there is progress in the process of codecision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="449"> The Commission is, with the simple majority votes in the situation in the future in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="450"> Now in the Union no, whose view on the year 2030 fixed, but people with in the position to recognize the problems which the within by extending it and to find the answers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="451"> It is therefore a out a work, which was not accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="452"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="453"> This basic, one by one, at best, not more, if the worst comes to the worst. </SEG> 
<SEG id="454"> Democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy kränkelt. </SEG> 
<SEG id="455"> The European Parliament has today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, and a simple statement: yes, you in the European Constitution, yes, we want it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="456"> The problem is a criterion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="457"> I shall concentrate on the heart of the matter, in that I concentrate on the essential points of the report to which I would, to which I would like to briefly, that I find it calls. </SEG> 
<SEG id="458"> Next, the simplification of the Treaties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="459"> I would like to leave it at that, because of the university Institute of Florence does here - at least for me - not to the discussion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="460"> According to the information - it is now very technical, you will see the request for me - the Presidency, in a clear majority of the majority of the Italian version of the application of the only on the most disadvantaged islands and not referred to the islands in general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="461"> Mr Duhamel, you would agree with me that, in the event that there is no room for success, or at least no, about the future of European integration, at least not in the current context. </SEG> 
<SEG id="462"> It is also in this European Constitution, the distribution between the Member States and the European Union institutions, and the dynamics of European integration in areas where it is essential to involve to act jointly, as in the foreign and security policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="463"> It will require sustained blockade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="464"> We need a clearer distribution of responsibilities and a clearer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="465"> Of course, there are different views in the various Member States, with the different social. </SEG> 
<SEG id="466"> The final a European Constitution would not, however, precisely the opposite, and therefore we cannot agree. </SEG> 
<SEG id="467"> Because in the European House, it becomes a political and the table, and then the other side. </SEG> 
<SEG id="468"> The second version is clearly not correct, because on the one hand by the structural funds through the structural funds, and there are other after this interpretation is no reason for the adoption of the interpretation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="469"> Mr President, I will be brief in my humble 60 seconds on the report by Olivier Duhamel, because he is, since it is actually in the allocation and the and our rapporteur quite convinced us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="470"> In my opinion, the unity of Europe only political nature. </SEG> 
<SEG id="471"> In our opinion, should the new State to the next European elections and will enter into force. </SEG> 
<SEG id="472"> Consequently, the term "most disadvantaged", both on the island, as well as on the four areas, and after the proposal by Mr Barnier here, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention of Vienna, a policy of the Italian text. </SEG> 
<SEG id="473"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="474"> As the honourable Member said, they wanted to vote against this proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="475"> Mr President, one is looking for a recipe for Israel. </SEG> 
<SEG id="476"> I welcome the adoption of high quality by the Parliament of blood or blood and blood derivatives from blood or plasma. </SEG> 
<SEG id="477"> If the European is then had the with the lifting of the immunity of Mr Le Pen at us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="478"> I am especially about the voting on the report on the increase. </SEG> 
<SEG id="479"> The one from alcohol as tobacco and drugs for a product, with consumer and their fellow can cause great damage to others, see it as a means to the creation of jobs and a bubbling source. </SEG> 
<SEG id="480"> The rapporteur welcomes in general in the title of the Commission's proposals on this subject is, however, concerned about the possible impact of the reform on the enforcement of competition rules to decentralise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="481"> In the debate yesterday evening, I have indeed Jonathan Evans on his work, but I just beginning my criticism of the Liberals, if not absolutely ultraliberal bias of his report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="482"> The Group has these main themselves in the next three years the projects during the coming jobs in the objective 1 area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="483"> In view of the consequences of this policy that every time it, with the help of economic, financial and other economic or tax incentives, the situation at least partially. </SEG> 
<SEG id="484"> (the sitting was suspended at hours p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="485"> So we now stand in October 2000, shortly before the resolution on the budget 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="486"> This has not prevented the Council but, with the expenditure on the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="487"> Moreover, we are of the opinion that not with simply created simply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="488"> The Council, I can only say, follow us! </SEG> 
<SEG id="489"> Therefore, the administration of this House for the Members of Parliament and not the other way round. </SEG> 
<SEG id="490"> The European Court of Auditors makes us at present, at least. </SEG> 
<SEG id="491"> Finally, the budget is also of us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="492"> On the contrary, we are of the opinion that it is precisely in view of the countries of the research should be forced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="493"> In addition, we propose that the Parliament will be informed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="494"> And if a legislative culture to social issues, to culture or environmental programme - the Commissioner will give me right - then we put together, the Commissioner for the budget, the finance Ministers and the Members of the Committee on Budgets, is done without inconsistency is committed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="495"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your friendly welcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="496"> Rather, it has already approved in the first reading of the budget for 2001 to it, without justified in tactical considerations, the goal of an adequate use, that the Community institutions must continue to have only been possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="497"> Before you on the 2001, I would like to highlight a number of objectives, on the between Council and Parliament, and to an agreement between the two branches of the budgetary authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="498"> In the structural policy, we are in a similar situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="499"> The culture in the summer - on Mr Colom I Naval has referred to a good result, namely that in the future the put with Parliament, to be provided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="500"> I would remind you that in the last year, last year for the Balkans were planned for the whole period until 2006. </SEG> 
<SEG id="501"> I ask once again - the Commission of its proposal on the table -, this proposal also unbiased and as a possibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="502"> The material was both for the planning of the 2001 budget, as also for the discharge for the year 1999 obviously very wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="503"> So I as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, the work of this Group, and so I also the work of the rapporteur and the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets, I want it as rapporteur for the Committee for economic and currency but not on two proposals to which the Committee again in the plenary and whose importance, despite not entirely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="504"> With these measures, we want the international control full confidence, confidence in the European Union and to the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="505"> The of the Commission by the deletion of this initiative was a clear choice of political will of Lisbon and the majority of this House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="506"> This decision was very back, and many of us with the feeling that this important programme between the budget between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission too. </SEG> 
<SEG id="507"> My third point is the European agricultural policy, as they are now in the preliminary draft budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="508"> If the employment a priority of the Union, may represent the fishing as a front. </SEG> 
<SEG id="509"> I am particularly pleased about the fact that the funding for the last year 1999 programmes, Socrates, youth and culture 2000 could be ensured. </SEG> 
<SEG id="510"> The decline in our budgetary amount on the Budgets of several years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="511"> Mr President, in the past years ago I was the spokesman for the Committee on culture, youth, education, the media and sport, in whose name this afternoon, Mrs Iivari. </SEG> 
<SEG id="512"> But I would like to say this afternoon also say that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU is only 1% of GDP and uses a large part is administered in the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="513"> Let me now turn to the general strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="514"> Here I would now in the strategy of my parliamentary Group, for the departure of our aspiration to protect, for the European Union, an to ensure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="515"> On the contrary, we need a Parliament which, for transparency, efficiency and an effective democratic control of the European institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="516"> Then we must consider how we can solve this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="517"> We want democratic processes, and we want a balanced relationship between the traditional fields, which we now have before us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="518"> The greatest problem in the new measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="519"> Economies economies is obviously needed by us, and on which we should also not away. </SEG> 
<SEG id="520"> This is an extraordinary initiative, especially in the first reading, and it is an initiative because it under the present circumstances, no coordination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="521"> Nevertheless, the scope of the extension of the Kosovo some problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="522"> With the budgetary policy, we need the confidence of the citizens in the European policy on. </SEG> 
<SEG id="523"> All measures to small- and medium-sized businesses are therefore also. </SEG> 
<SEG id="524"> The size of the budget </SEG> 
<SEG id="525"> One this strategic line as approach for the Budgets of this and of the coming years with the Parliament takes its place in the budgetary fully and entirely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="526"> With the transmission of 175 million euros around EUR 25 million euros more than we expected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="527"> On the subject of MEDA told the Council relationships are no problem, because eight years became. </SEG> 
<SEG id="528"> I believe, Mr Duff was this morning, when we present to the European Council in Biarritz. </SEG> 
<SEG id="529"> My answer is quite simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="530"> Ramiro Zapata was the last one, and the government of the "of the groups, following the activists should be followed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="531"> The current position of the Council is satisfied me somewhat as July, but the European Union, as we have already experienced in many situations, always as last and to use their vote to bring. </SEG> 
<SEG id="532"> My question is, and I will conclude on this point, if there is no pressure so that, as the President of the Commission and its President, and whether the aid which we want to make the aid from the United States on the country, that they are not on the cultivation of other crops and not on the military, but on the social aspects. </SEG> 
<SEG id="533"> I and the other Members who have asked questions refer specifically to the situation in Colombia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="534"> As they deal with the same subject, questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 common problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="535"> Subject: taxation of the demand for a taxation of capital gains in recent months is becoming more and more ground so numerous numerous (association pour les sur l'aide pour l) in France and Europe and in the French national Assembly and in the proposals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="536"> One should also answer the question of what influence it on the have, in particular, with a set of 0.1%, while the speculators with devaluations in the order of 20 to 50%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="537"> In paragraph 26, it demands the installation of an international debts of the debts of the countries of the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="538"> That was also the way it with the case, regardless of whether one regrets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="539"> What, what I regard as the countries of the South, has said, I would like to add that the development of a tax, for example, that a tax in the manner of the Tobin tax revenue from 50 to 250 million during per annum were 40 billion dollars per year suffice for a minimum conditions for the hundreds of millions of people, to ensure that in the countries of the third world at all about. </SEG> 
<SEG id="540"> In recent months, the plague, among other things, in various parts of France. </SEG> 
<SEG id="541"> Now, as the representative of the Presidency is here, I would like to know whether, from the EU or from the national budget and whether it is paid for their it out of the EU budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="542"> I would ask you to give their consent, that they can be answered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="543"> The freedom of the two that government is therefore by international law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="544"> I cannot see how the Commission is already in February in addition, what they need, and the Council in July. </SEG> 
<SEG id="545"> If the Union in the name of such an action on the day in in reality of its to task, as they did in the past few weeks, both in Italy, as well as in Spain has done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="546"> How can I, as a Member of the European Parliament, this majority lies at the heart of a billion pounds from British taxpayers' money - that is our present - and if the broad public stand? </SEG> 
<SEG id="547"> With a flexible attitude on the part of the Council in second reading, an agreement will be found for the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="548"> If someone yet convinced, on the evidence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="549"> Joan Colom I Naval, for the President, has introduced this strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="550"> As Mrs Schreyer has already mentioned, the reorganization of the agricultural policy, the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy, safety, protection and better execution of the structural, implementation of the decisions of the Lisbon Summit for the creation of a stronger and more competitive EU and to combat social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="551"> The war has too much and sorrow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="552"> Despite the agreements, I wonder whether, if it is possible, this objective in the context of the compromise to reach, in the present, for a sustainable in the current Member States, to undermine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="553"> And I have to say to you: it must get its chance: here, and I hope that in the next few weeks or months also for an Amnesty, now, but I am quite that at the political level and in terms of the budget, the introduction of these two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, political conditions attached. </SEG> 
<SEG id="554"> The elections in Yugoslavia have two: the people have Finally enough of Milosevic, and they have confidence in Professor event. </SEG> 
<SEG id="555"> I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners are released. </SEG> 
<SEG id="556"> We do not, it will, it will inevitably result, both in the general economic, social and environmental issues, as well as with the cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="557"> At the same time initiatives for the solution to the problems of social problems, such as unemployment, asked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="558"> Of course, a fact that I classify as enormously important, namely that we began with category 4, they have taken and ones, but is not completely clear whether there now a solution, it is also, therefore, no, because the Council is willing to cooperate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="559"> In each household, it is important to set priorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="560"> It is with a view to the expiry of the Treaty in the near future, not very seriously, but it would be unfortunate if the on the following the to give such practices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="561"> That leads to my third comment, which is now before us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="562"> The new finance that does not produce the distrust of the politicians in the EU, so I have voted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="563"> For them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="564"> The dialogue has an unprecedented international collaboration, which I hope will allow, in the first reading to reach an agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="565"> We voted for the European values in a country, now have a further argument for the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, for the citizens in the modern society, of great importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="566"> I have noticed that in my own country now a law on personal data should, by which the Members of the committees in the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="567"> On a number of further points, we also see the here the judgment must be sure to go to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="568"> (FR) the Commission would like to refer to the obligation, which we all vis-à-vis the citizens, the protection of personal data processed by the institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="569"> With this, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation to the activities in the context of the first pillar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="570"> The political agreement with the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for adoption at first reading agreement, they will, therefore, any such proposal, which is not in the Committee for freedoms and rights of the citizens of reform in the Paciotti report contained, irrespective of the French proposal around the correction of 41. </SEG> 
<SEG id="571"> It is therefore imperative that the manpower for Group within the general secretariat of the Commission is increased, so that by acts with general range for their examination by the Council on the basis of Article 299 (2) a detailed assessment can be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="572"> From the point of view of the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market, I am keen to emphasise that the EU can really only just what is also. </SEG> 
<SEG id="573"> In view of the importance of fisheries for the regions in this very. </SEG> 
<SEG id="574"> Since, under the Presidency of formed a benefit for the regions in this way, we have a long and fruitful way, and I, the one who has, thanks to the border living. </SEG> 
<SEG id="575"> So, thus already to a reference to the French, but it lasted until 1989 and up to the solution of the programmes for the solution of the remoteness and insularity, specifically the problem until the European Union Finally recognised that the character and the justified the structural disadvantages of the regions in a treatment in comparison to other regions of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="576"> I do not doubt that the proposals which the Commission will propose to the Council, of these characteristics. </SEG> 
<SEG id="577"> This question is all the more relevant to the more closely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="578"> This right of differentiation is nothing further as a result of the principle of equality, therefore also the conditions to deal with what is different. </SEG> 
<SEG id="579"> It is a document which my team, and I as rich in ideas and that the core of the problems and the concern in the regions in the Community gives rise to concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="580"> In her report, Mrs Sudre, rightly highlighted the need for an integrated approach. </SEG> 
<SEG id="581"> With the revival of the economic diversification, we have made progress in a number of essential areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="582"> Now it is important that a large number of projects in the framework of the proposed, but in parallel to this, we need the specific needs, the access of each of these regions in the entrance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="583"> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting </SEG> 
<SEG id="584"> Of course, I am the President about your reference to inform. </SEG> 
<SEG id="585"> I am concerned about the decisions of the House and the decisions in question, because the necessary regulations for such a case lapses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="586"> Both this, as well as the us view on the guarantee of food safety, will receive the support of this Parliament, Mr Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="587"> The main lies on the scientific advice, because the discussion on food safety must decide on an objective basis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="588"> Mr President, I would like it does not, the rapporteur, for his constructive contribution and for his readiness to the opinions of the other committees, to express my thanks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="589"> When we are confronted with a potential risk, the precautionary principle must be applied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="590"> What is still the question concerns what we in the remit of this authority, but also the Commission, as well as the consultation and assessment of the risk of this, we are of the view that this would standards in all the questions of food safety, which should be an opinion and their support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="591"> Of key importance is about the preservation of the rich traditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="592"> It does not, it will not through legislation, not by regulations, but through by top quality, transparency and accountability, transparency and through. </SEG> 
<SEG id="593"> Good scientific knowledge are certainly when the risks in connection with the food chain, from farm to table, better value. </SEG> 
<SEG id="594"> Mr President, there is no doubt that the establishment of a European Agency for food safety, as our rapporteur, you call for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="595"> If the necessary resources, as well as the necessary support, we need, we must, above all, an Agency with a on the 15 Member States of the European Union so limited range. </SEG> 
<SEG id="596"> Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because the consumers want healthy, and for that we need greater support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="597"> If we do not get new framework, we will be in the area of food safety only. </SEG> 
<SEG id="598"> Therefore in support for the Commission in the area of food in the recognition given to this today so as they have in the area of competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="599"> I support all the partners, whether in political, administrative or other at the strategy "food for all '. </SEG> 
<SEG id="600"> I agree with this statement when not when a person is even more than merely a body. </SEG> 
<SEG id="601"> The authority must be on the coordination of the national agencies, which are a network of the for food safety on the level of the individual regions on the way must bring and coordinate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="602"> Your proposal, and my amendment 17, therefore, absolutely in agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="603"> The reform of the European Union should, at the level of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="604"> In his report, is not so very main priorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="605"> In the report, we have clearly formulated this demand, which I welcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="606"> The creation of a European authority for food safety, however, is extremely positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="607"> In the interest of all citizens is that these criteria are complied with. </SEG> 
<SEG id="608"> In my opinion, concrete, within which the European Commission over every cause for concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="609"> The EU must guarantee its citizens in which high standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="610"> The Commission now proposes the establishment of a European authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="611"> I am concerned that Europe is to risk a apparatus to do, is to act. </SEG> 
<SEG id="612"> Ever more new levels we create and ever more money we spend less through. </SEG> 
<SEG id="613"> Prevent similar and parallel work in international institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="614"> It is important, however, to avoid that in the shadow of the discussion on the book the fear of a Europe that is on the quality of the products, as, without taking effective action against the gesundheitsgefährdende and consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="615"> As you know, the strategy for the authority in the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="616"> The Commission will be making a proposal for a regulation, the framework for action in which the principles and objectives of food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="617"> Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="618"> But now to our report: I value the proposal of the Commission as positive and have to say that the Committee for foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy and the Committee on development and cooperation for an intensive work, in order to improve it, especially in certain points, continue to improve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="619"> As our colleague Mrs Bonino and clearly, with the proposal of the Commission a further step forward. </SEG> 
<SEG id="620"> We consider the proposal for a regulation from the Commission for too vague. </SEG> 
<SEG id="621"> It is essential that the equipment, according to which research projects and operations and instruments that they so that they just in the developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="622"> In the past eight years, we have more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget for mine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="623"> We can, however, the same for their government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="624"> As I have already said, it is indeed well thought through and the growth of Ottawa binding and to conditions for the support by the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="625"> I reject the proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="626"> Secondly, the international Community coordination at global level, and particularly in the affected countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="627"> Mr President, the Socialist Group agrees the by Mr van Orden, and is also proud of the role of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="628"> We remember the Soviet in Afghanistan! </SEG> 
<SEG id="629"> Thank you for the good report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="630"> Mr President, the mines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="631"> The people and have the people has been built in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="632"> Mr President, I am happy that there is Finally a European legislation in the form of a regulation on the ban and that a good report by Mrs Bonino on this regulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="633"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced today with a very sad topic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="634"> The mines do not lie primarily in regions, i.e. in areas where different initiatives could be taken in order to these crises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="635"> In two distance from a Bosnian village, in 1999, a sign to work, which, however, does not prevent a little boy plays there. </SEG> 
<SEG id="636"> It is tragic, if the efficiency of its. </SEG> 
<SEG id="637"> Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our institution, with their country special relations in the framework of our common intention to the construction of an area of prosperity, security and peace in the Mediterranean, our security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="638"> Mines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="639"> Mr President, since I agree with almost everything, what my colleagues have said previously, I do not want to repeat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="640"> Their view of open cooperation is synonymous with a in the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="641"> We also believe in the fact that decisions as close to those affected as possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="642"> Since, however, the proposals of the Group of the European people's Party and a notable, I have voted in favour of the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="643"> Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the results of the informal European Council of Conference for two reasons: Firstly, because I had the opportunity, notably on the paragraphs 2 and 5 and refusal of both. </SEG> 
<SEG id="644"> In other words, at the table of the common European House some à la carte feed themselves with the '. </SEG> 
<SEG id="645"> And the democratic control must not diminish our. however is the major problem of the European Union in these rights or their incorporation into the Treaties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="646"> The instrument and the Commission proposals relating to this report have already been mentioned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="647"> With the election to the European Parliament from 1999, only 40% turnout in the countries with and which, at the same time with the national elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="648"> The goal of a European Constitution, it is not advisable, figures and methods to impose disastrous consequences of the missing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="649"> A real social State the achievements of the women, women and the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="650"> (PT) I have not voted for, although I do not view the involvement and strengthening of the European Union and the simplification of the text, for their proximity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="651"> The distribution of competences </SEG> 
<SEG id="652"> In my opinion, it is of crucial importance that the Charter of fundamental rights in the EU a connection to the Convention of the Council of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="653"> The report by Mr Gil-Robles comes to me, however, to aid, because it is the suggestion that some Member States of the European Union in certain questions, sectors and areas of a joint action on each other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="654"> If on ever more important subjects will be decided by qualified majority decisions, basic standards of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="655"> Today, during it, the flexible cooperation to production, and also on this subject. </SEG> 
<SEG id="656"> The present report is the position of our Parliament European (resolution of 13 April 2000). </SEG> 
<SEG id="657"> We stand in large part of a so-called flexible cooperation positively. </SEG> 
<SEG id="658"> The British labour Members of the Socialist Group welcome the agreement to your contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on the problem of reinforced cooperation, even if they do not agree with all the details. </SEG> 
<SEG id="659"> This word must actively as part of the European Union, which, I hope, in a paradise for the tourists, as also for the local population change. </SEG> 
<SEG id="660"> In the Middle ages of these regions and their likely to Europe, and also with you today as a really European. </SEG> 
<SEG id="661"> In fact, the characteristics of these regions, which, in general, from their position and to the European mainland, but also from dependence on some product or a single product being required that these obstacles, specific measures to be taken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="662"> Mr President, I apologise if I and the interpreters, once again, my last explanation of vote to be, and I would like in particular my solidarity with our, in my case, the Italian feelings. </SEG> 
<SEG id="663"> From these texts that clearly emphasises that this Agency on the health or the national about them in the service to provide. </SEG> 
<SEG id="664"> This does not, however, the Commission and Parliament on this institution as a European authority ", although this equipment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="665"> This does not exactly what the Bowis report with which one has the feeling, the authority will largely as a further by means of which the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of the national institutions and the security of the citizens to continue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="666"> I therefore consider it to be appropriate, through this on behalf of our European Parliament, the reason for the respect for religious freedom and tolerance between religious freedom and the tolerance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="667"> Madam President, I understand the objections of the rapporteur, but with the proposals of the Committee on agriculture and rural development is not just about money, but it is also about a certain direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="668"> I would like to ask you also here that we have the budgetary acquisition of property, according to adapt, depending on what proposals will be adopted, so that we take our own limit of 20% of total administrative expenditure not. </SEG>

<SEG id="675"> Nevertheless, it is the Parliament managed, through a series of important tasks - not least in view of the fight against unemployment in the fight against unemployment and poverty, etc., etc., we have and against the attacks against the right to life and the European women 's lobby. </SEG> 
<SEG id="676"> What the travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament is concerned, we consider that in our view that this only for the costs incurred in TRIPS may be paid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="677"> I assume - and I hope that the Commission will increase constructive with concern - that we have the three years between 2002 and 2005, with a. </SEG>

<SEG id="696"> We cannot force the banks to pregnant, but as politicians we the proposal of Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, it is for the PPE-DE Group submitted for before the end of next year, and perhaps also the existence of corresponding standards in the introduction of the euro-coins and demanding, seem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="697"> The proposal by Mrs Peijs and is also in the direction the banks at a table, not in order to make, but because we cannot from the political side but not more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="698"> If, namely the settlement is expensive remains as today, the new in question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="699"> In our view, this form of the collection of statistical data on the internal transactions a relic of the past, that in an integrated market which is no longer justified and the smooth functioning of the internal market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="700"> When I hear the by some of my colleagues in the Committee, which this House already long, when I hear, I have the impression that with the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which the European Parliament now, for the fourth time in this category. </SEG> 
<SEG id="701"> I thank you in advance for the support of my report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="702"> But if we, at European level, then the regions have increased. </SEG> 
<SEG id="703"> The SMEs are, in the first place, with the creation, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and act in this way, a problem for the social cohesion and the planning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="704"> Through the study of the proposals and the vote with the interested parties, it has a contribution to clearer wording of the programme and its optimum preparation process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="705"> Thirdly, we must use the benefits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="706"> Hence, it follows that small and medium-sized enterprises and only then, if the unemployment too, and if the Parliament at all levels of debt, and this means that in the Bank. </SEG>

<SEG id="711"> I would like that of the Commissioner in connection with all the measures proposed here with that an easier and quicker access to assistance and information is created, so that these businesses able effectively to use this information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="712"> All of you will find its place in the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="713"> Finally, I also welcome the idea that we meet once a year, about balance over the implementation of the programme. </SEG>

<SEG id="716"> We need, particularly on Albania tailored took a construction or the reconstruction of the country and, as a life in the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="717"> So the documents of a body to others, and the European Commission is refusing, for example, the report, including the of the Albanians customs assistance mission (). </SEG> 
<SEG id="718"> Let us look the truth in the eye. </SEG> 
<SEG id="719"> Mrs Karamanou, to the broad and comprehensive tour of your report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="720"> This is an extremely important question from the historical, social, political and economic facts. </SEG>

<SEG id="722"> Joint medium-sized family ties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="723"> What I, however, totally in this report, and I would simply like to refer is that cause and effect, i.e. the illegal immigration with a weighted visas and therefore the confused and it is precisely the other way around. </SEG> 
<SEG id="724"> The Treaty of Amsterdam diverted large institutional reforms had repercussions on the treatment of problems and immigration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="725"> Thirdly and Finally, the action plan and its implementation, be considered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="726"> But this also at the request of the us itself economically with European regulations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="727"> This joint actions must be particularly emphasised just now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="728"> Furthermore, I plead for that in the EC proposals will be presented at the existing directives or regulations are worked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="729"> The correctly understood, shows us in both directions: decisions on the plane to meet, but why that from time to time on a very high level, if it can be, namely to common values threatens, if they are not everywhere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="730"> The report is a classic for clear wording and I hope colleagues will take serious note of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="731"> The report of the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market, with its Members not to his commitment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="732"> I am in the report about the SLIM, because the legislation of the Union, Mr Medina, has given us with one of the articles of the Treaty, is just one of the Community for experts heavily. </SEG> 
<SEG id="733"> Therefore some aspects of the report in so little enthusiasm, because I have a "vergemeinschaftenden 'report in terms of the internal market, and it is clear that it is not just the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="734"> For the EU, it is important that we have the obligation to the quality of the report, in particular with regard to the to improve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="735"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="736"> The persistence of this condition the attitude and the negative influence on the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="737"> Mr President, we have with very great care in the Committee for the freedoms and rights, justice and home Affairs the Karamanou report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="738"> But as chairman of the Committee on fisheries, I would like our request and this debate benefits for both sides - then our is directed at both sides - some, and I would like to do that with large consideration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="739"> This is the demand of the peoples of the Union, which we represent here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="740"> Much water down the Rhine system, the agreement is Nevertheless and was not replaced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="741"> I can understand, Mr Commissioner, however, but not the President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="742"> We could say that we 30 months after the closure of the for the previous agreement and the previous one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="743"> Mr President, I have a similar debate we had a year ago, and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations, because it shows how difficult it is for our extensive supply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="744"> The second agreement was the clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="745"> But we must realise that all the resources! </SEG> 
<SEG id="746"> Therefore, I am particularly keen to make it clear that the Group, the PPE-DE, not only at the same time, the administration has to defend and to women, but also their corruption committed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="747"> Thirdly, the exploitation of the grounds for the suspension of the abandonment of the Community and others and others, which neither the control by the Commission or by the Member States nor, above all, of a major fleet from the Netherlands. </SEG> 
<SEG id="748"> I understand the challenges for the future, was a source of income and created jobs for one in terms of the poor region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="749"> A further aspect on which I would particularly like to refer, in view of the financial aid for fishermen and shipowners served as compensation for this situation. this situation is social aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="750"> I as a parliamentarian for a year, on which, in which, in the Committee on fisheries and in the talks with the Commissioner that the special nature of the fleet in the capture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="751"> Spain has the difficult in the history of also between Europe and Africa and between Spain and Morocco, in an excellent way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="752"> As Spanish and as I invite the right of thousands and Spanish families on conservation and protection of their jobs, for almost a year, and that we are also out of this Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="753"> We shall now proceed to the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="754"> An almost their full personal, also need, in order for the concerned about the defence of old rights as its right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="755"> As you know, the matter is extremely complex and concerns of 700, at 25 Italian universities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="756"> If the Italian legal system, as it was the case, can the Commission not to intervene, but we believe that every European citizen on the same procedures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="757"> The injustice consists of the fact that two people on the one side by side, but different for different conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="758"> At worst, it is, I think, if one point which has to make a judgement in its favour only some, and for your and importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="759"> I expect an answer from the Commission on the point that it in accordance with the decision of the Court of justice in the case against Article 48 (2), if in the legislation of a Member State, the duration of respectively on a year, with the possibility of extension, while in relation to other if such a limit does not exist. </SEG> 
<SEG id="760"> Now, in my view, this concerns the very core of the European right, fundamental principles of freedom, in particular, and of these principles, there can be no exceptions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="761"> We have, as well as the current debate shows, nor a great many obstacles for the internal market, not only in this case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="762"> We shall now proceed to the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="763"> (the President cut the speaker off.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="764"> In condolence to the Klestil and Chancellor remarks, I have, on behalf of our House and the entire people at this difficult time our interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="765"> Are there any comments? </SEG> 
<SEG id="766"> I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and would be very grateful if the Council indicate whether he actually intends to present a new proposal in this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="767"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our Group considers this event is so important that we feel that it is in the form of an urgency, not only that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="768"> Mr Barón Crespo, I have the impression that you, if I have understood you correctly, this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="769"> Madam President, some time ago we debated in this House over the sanction over Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="770"> It is absolutely essential that we carry out the changes by the British authorities announced a discussion, and the Commission must clearly to the legal provisions in this question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="771"> (A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on citizens' freedoms and rights, justice and home Affairs on the initiative of the French Republic, in view of the conclusion of an agreement on the reform of the legal assistance in criminal matters, especially in the area of combating organized crime, as well as proposals from the world as well as the -- / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="772"> The steps concrete steps must follow, so that the proceeds from crime frozen, seized and confiscated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="773"> The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice must not be in the hands of a only under the exclusive control of the national governments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="774"> On the other hand, the reasons for the refusal of the aid, on which a Member State can call on the essential interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="775"> First of all I would like to congratulate on his work, and point out that in the efforts and the support, but also, no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="776"> If terrorists and arms or as well as these has uncovered, pursued and punished! </SEG> 
<SEG id="777"> It is our task, the proceeds from organised crime and to determine to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="778"> These points, it goes into the Treaties, and following the discussion in the Committee, I am very confident that this Parliament for that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="779"> It seems to me that this catalogue of initiatives in a direction in Article 6 of the European Convention for the protection of the rights and freedoms of the planned protection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="780"> In reality, but things are not so simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="781"> Finally, the PPE Group supports the proposal and the activities to which we have with Mrs Roure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="782"> The second, the second instrument is the harmonisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="783"> This is a Portuguese initiative, to which several speakers already praising. </SEG> 
<SEG id="784"> And that was also the aim of the joint meeting of the justice and home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council on 17 October this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="785"> The best form for a strengthening of parliamentary and judicial control over Europol is the agreement in the framework of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="786"> A step in the right direction, which the European Parliament has been seeking for a long time, is the creation of a place for judicial cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="787"> This is the sense of the guarantees, namely in the development of this aspect of the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="788"> And the European Parliament is the joint instance with my with my contribution, I would like to ask you to these relations and our rapporteur to give their consent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="789"> Firstly, if clarity about the institutional model and the rules for the future of the European judicial area, and the citizens and the European Parliament to the Council proposed single. </SEG> 
<SEG id="790"> This is a part of the efforts through the fight of the heavy organized an area of freedom, security and justice, as well as a high degree of safety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="791"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one which Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent report, the decision by the Council in Tampere decision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="792"> One but, as in the case of coordination at the level of the national public prosecutors and judges to all forms of crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - then it is an extension of the draft: it is no longer just about cooperation with the crimes, but it means to fight criminal offences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="793"> We will have from 1 January 2001, will have in this place to the legal means to engage the Commission intends, in the discussion about the appearance of recovery. </SEG> 
<SEG id="794"> It was from all sides of all sides - I think - without, however, however. </SEG> 
<SEG id="795"> The problems in connection with the issues were not too serious for the Committee on fisheries; other areas of interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="796"> It is quite unacceptable that we have no clear goals and cannot measure the results this in no other institution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="797"> Second point: in the area of the Union, it came to power it, Mr Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="798"> I would like to make it clear that the programme with some questions has played a positive role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="799"> It is obvious that this work within concerning the terms of the joint financial responsibility for this issue is complex. </SEG> 
<SEG id="800"> We have therefore really used for this 3.4 million, and one can say that the more than 90% succeeded. </SEG> 
<SEG id="801"> There are objections? </SEG> 
<SEG id="802"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after long and for a consensus of the Charter of fundamental rights in the draft. </SEG> 
<SEG id="803"> I hope that this Parliament, even if it is only now saying yes to this Charter of fundamental rights, which have no doubts that it from the Council, the European Court of justice that is the people also have access to the European Court. </SEG> 
<SEG id="804"> This position is, as we know, with the Heads of State and government at the meeting of the European Council in Biarritz, unanimously approved unanimously, and I can therefore only request, on behalf of the Council, this position, as I represent some for you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="805"> Above all, however, my through its conviction - as I would like to say - meaning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="806"> The European trade Union Confederation, about that - as he calls it - complained, such as, for example, the absence of a reference to the right to an income. </SEG> 
<SEG id="807"> Regardless of several, and especially some of the Members of the European Parliament, a reference to the Charter of fundamental rights, in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which is already a reference to the European Convention on human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="808"> Our Group agrees with the exception of the British delegation of the Charter unanimously. </SEG> 
<SEG id="809"> We stand out as the European people 's Party, and for that the Charter as soon as possible in the action taken, so that they are also direct force for the people in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="810"> You have shown that the European questions on a new and exemplary way based on their democratically open and transparent approach and the possibility of a form of Intergovernmental superior. </SEG> 
<SEG id="811"> The right to health, security, housing or on income are entirely or in the area of solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="812"> Fourthly: the Charter - and this is particularly important - comes from the indivisibility of fundamental human and social rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="813"> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, this is only the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union again and again to produce. </SEG> 
<SEG id="814"> The Court has already given to recognise that one of the Charter, the will and the representatives of the Commission in the Convention in Turin attaches importance to the document. </SEG> 
<SEG id="815"> According to the time of the market is so after the hour of the Europe of the rights of the concept of the European Union is in a relatively new concept. </SEG> 
<SEG id="816"> The Charter is, in fact, conceived as a text that can show the legally. </SEG> 
<SEG id="817"> With pride, I can also State that a representative of my parliamentary Group in my homeland, Mr Gunnar, a very important role to play in the development of this Charter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="818"> As I already said yesterday evening, and I do so again today, starting in this regard Union still too many so if it to us in our legal and police cooperation are not specific and to prevent that now going to passive victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="819"> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament to the Charter of fundamental rights is based on the same uncertainty, as the work of the Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="820"> The Italian Constitution provides, for example, the limit of morals, and the Convention the consequence of the rights of other or the public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="821"> Mr President, in today's vote at 12 noon, we launched a process that began in this Parliament when the draft of the Treaty on the European Union, which is already a rights was demanded, and the 1989 with the resolution of the de Gucht was. </SEG> 
<SEG id="822"> The Charter will have consequences, whether they be enshrined in the Treaty or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="823"> It is to be welcomed, and not, as Mr Bonde seems to think. </SEG> 
<SEG id="824"> Clearly, is the self-tending Europe, with all its the release of the disadvantaged social classes, slipped away and has taught us nothing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="825"> The Charter as a right and in the protection of the individual vis-à-vis the European police authorities, as well as well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="826"> The rejection, however, with the incompleteness of the Charter, I cannot comprehend. </SEG> 
<SEG id="827"> Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton. </SEG> 
<SEG id="828"> Allow me to make a third comment to the rights of nationals of third countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="829"> The Council of Europe for the Court of justice for the extensive, on which we can build. </SEG> 
<SEG id="830"> In view of the text of the Charter, which we will give our assent today - as I hope with large majority -, it is obvious that we are more and more and a basic legal protection, as it will reach the accession to the European Convention on human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="831"> We must therefore continue to progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="832"> I believe that we must pursue this, if we have the necessary support for the Charter by the citizens of Europe want to achieve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="833"> After its adoption by this Parliament is the same as for this report, and, as my intellectual and me to personnel resources put it to me, I shall be a right and countries in compliance with the Charter in the countries of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="834"> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to join all the words of President, and the essential contribution of the Members of the European Parliament to debate in this challenge and, in particular, the role of Mr Mendes de Vigo, which, in the drafting of the Charter of fundamental rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="835"> I would like just to some of the points of this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="836"> The Convention has done well out of the Council of Europe and the constitutions of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="837"> The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports: </SEG> 
<SEG id="838"> In the current State of Affairs, our Parliament the people also to make it clear that there are at least three preconditions for its accession. </SEG> 
<SEG id="839"> Such conditions would, Moreover, not only by Parliament ’ s decision to be provided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="840"> I have, therefore, by Mr Morillon made to the preconditions for the accession of Turkey to note the great interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="841"> I am happy to say that the Turkish government in the meantime this as a basis for further cooperation has recognised, so that we have a justified hope to achieve precisely what we wanted to achieve, namely our policy with the reform in Turkey to help new impetus to the reform process and will, in view of the European project in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="842"> That for me most is that after Helsinki in Turkey, in a debate about the conditions of accession of Turkey to the EU is a debate, the powers of the country and demands. </SEG> 
<SEG id="843"> This text lies with them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="844"> There is therefore a necessary impetus for a future accession. </SEG> 
<SEG id="845"> I would nonetheless - I do not know how the vote goes - Turkey urgently request, also to take this issue seriously. </SEG> 
<SEG id="846"> The European Parliament is actively for the reception and care of relations with the political parties, the NGOs and the press and strives for an improvement in their difficult and sometimes tense great Assembly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="847"> Mr Morillon, your report is, in my opinion, a responsible and realistic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="848"> On the occasion of your visit in Turkey in March of this year, you have the problem of the Kurdish population of the Constitution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="849"> It shows by and large to suppose that the things to - and I quote - "a change in their habits and its". </SEG> 
<SEG id="850"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report with great concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="851"> Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs for the adoption of the draft Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (/ / 1 / 00 - C5 / 2000 - 2000 / - (AVC)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="852"> In any case, we must ourselves with the opportunities, with which we are about to discuss the power of the processing, aware that a and therefore the citizens more legal certainty meshed control is needed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="853"> Duff / Voggenhuber (A5-0325 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="854"> We would like to point out the following: </SEG> 
<SEG id="855"> The rights contained in the Charter are already enshrined in the national constitutions and of the national parliaments, the peoples and cultures will stand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="856"> 1, is: "are not" not established that this ban in public or in heavy order can be stopped in Article 52. </SEG> 
<SEG id="857"> We are in a short to these three reasons, in this order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="858"> The right of a government of its own Constitution is marking for a tyranny. </SEG> 
<SEG id="859"> But today, we have, as I would like to repeat all reason to be proud of how we this important stage for Europe have mastered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="860"> A society which is not only unacceptable, but no to a European company. </SEG> 
<SEG id="861"> What is our fight for the basic over the political decisions about. </SEG> 
<SEG id="862"> The process of the Convention is indeed very interesting and efficiently for the achievement of a text of a broad consensus, but in no way, the European Parliament, as representatives of the European peoples to the public and to grant them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="863"> This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must a strategy is to update and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="864"> Therefore, it should be at the Council meeting in Nice not decided on, but of the Summit should be given for a European debate on the Charter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="865"> Fortunately appears in the national governments to follow the path of reason, i.e. a Charter with a purely political and not to take. </SEG> 
<SEG id="866"> The Summit as a "", has described this even the 'Convention' ", a concept of the responsibility in the form of a the excesses of the revolution in the form of terror. </SEG> 
<SEG id="867"> The procedure, the undertaken and the uncertainty regarding the nature of this text on board a clear light on the new approaches which are at the heart of European integration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="868"> The European Parliament in this area to the full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only a consultative role, but it takes resources and ways to use this so that correct. </SEG> 
<SEG id="869"> The views on the way, but go. </SEG> 
<SEG id="870"> That was a century so, and after it, in the background, it is now again fully and entirely in the foreground. </SEG> 
<SEG id="871"> In any case, what we want, which allow it through the back on the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="872"> We affirm as the establishment of a support of organized crime, and as well as the various proposed measures for achieving these objectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="873"> That is, it will be a place of cooperation or a representative of the States of our 15 Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="874"> Mr President, as a Member of the EU-Bulgaria joint parliamentary Committee, I am with the task of Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="875"> Also the behaviour of Turkey on Cyprus is unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="876"> We can, however, the crucial objection, and about the lack of an effective evaluation of the lending by the EIB and the lack of transparency and corresponding control of the activities of the Bank. </SEG> 
<SEG id="877"> Despite their differences, Turkey was and is an integral component of the European reality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="878"> The admission of Turkey into the European Union is to become an issue today is more topical than ever. </SEG> 
<SEG id="879"> Mr Morillon said, Turkey should give itself effort, the European Union wants to see it, Turkey wanted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="880"> Turkey is a real democratic country if they may have to live with their past, just as it is the democratic Germany, of which we have the same demands, has managed to live with its past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="881"> As soon as the government in Ankara has realised that the status quo for Europe and the world, is not acceptable, and would be a part of the island and a comprehensive, just and lasting and the solution to be found. </SEG> 
<SEG id="882"> Why are all these questions in the report of the European Commission not? </SEG> 
<SEG id="883"> In this context, we must balance of our work to the approach between the Union and Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="884"> If the Armenian issue in connection with the EU, you ask what I say: the Armenian issue in connection with the EU, then - is the project on which we have discussed today, this is so, it is as simple as that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="885"> For this reason, we have also so very committed, that after the first five years of the implementation of a result in Marseilles, so that we will be able to establish the necessary guidelines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="886"> But we have managed to maintain the dialogue and also sensitive issues such as terrorism, emigration, human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="887"> Politically it was the Council, especially since 1995, for the Mediterranean is resources available, the objectives of the partnership. </SEG> 
<SEG id="888"> This is, in fact, an important issue, and I would like to say that also as someone from Central Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="889"> Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English, a show without a star, as the first. </SEG> 
<SEG id="890"> It concerns about the association of policies to domestic and a consensus for the introduction in the conclusion of agreements and the acceptance of the harmonised Protocol on the cumulation of origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="891"> We also have the intention of the Commission, the intention of giving new impetus to, noted with satisfaction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="892"> I have highlighted these aspects, because here the key for the revival of the process and to seek out the political agenda of Barcelona must be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="893"> Therefore, our major the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and we must do everything in our power, so that this cooperation is enforced and accepted today, on the basis of the report - we say - generosity of the European Union be used efficiently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="894"> These are significant and concrete questions which I would like to place, and I would like to thank Mr Brok, this debate immediately before the appropriate consultations of the Presidency and the Commission on these subjects. </SEG> 
<SEG id="895"> The world is a mean, and in such a scenario is an organization in the field of international competition, as head where necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="896"> It is disappointing that the countries of the EUR 4.7 billion in MEDA ran the Council only on a fourth quarter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="897"> Therefore, the Commission 's proposal for a new impetus is positive and we fully endorse the priorities to which Mr Patten in its Constitution and to come here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="898"> This is an alarm signal for the European Union, a much more active role to play in the Mediterranean, our European continent historically and culturally enriching and strengthened. </SEG> 
<SEG id="899"> But worse still is that at the same time, because we in this House are sometimes differing viewpoints objectively exchange more killed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="900"> Aid for reconstruction </SEG> 
<SEG id="901"> We should not, however, in December the resources for the implementation of this regulation contributions on empty Straw. </SEG> 
<SEG id="902"> But we must not close our eyes and want the role you have played, and that the Member States - either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="903"> The media in that region were often responsible for the tragedy; it will be, because the freely according to the rules valid in our democracies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="904"> A man, I am also, therefore, because it is Parliament, as I believe that pressure is a State, not just as might be for the better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="905"> Once again: expenditure for meetings really must be avoided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="906"> We must, however, our view, not only on that point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="907"> The fact that some programmes of the so-called performance reserve, the 'performance reserve' ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="908"> In Feira, he has the stabilisation and association process involved in preparing the status as potential candidates for entry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="909"> I refer once again to the main objectives: institutional in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction and regional cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="910"> It was right that the European Union on the takeover by President Kostuníca has responded in a positive way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="911"> A first meeting was held on 6 November. </SEG> 
<SEG id="912"> What initiative in accordance with the request of the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000 does the Presidency intend to take in order to play a more active role for the full and complete implementation of the un-friedensplans? </SEG> 
<SEG id="913"> How can this enough without the settlement of this conflict? </SEG> 
<SEG id="914"> I can only that France and Germany - and here I am speaking not more than President - these issues on a bilateral meeting last week in and the development of a team for the solution to this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="915"> At the same time the Union both these countries continue to give aid over its various programmes, in particular. </SEG> 
<SEG id="916"> The Presidency would like to the question of the honourable Member to take some uncertainties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="917"> Let me the accuracy yet: the concern of both texts, it is the criminal framework for the organised gangs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="918"> In the report, that the Council of Ministers on 21 September this year on year in the relevant to the taking of measures for effective equality of men and women in the educational sphere in the area of civil law in force in the family; condemnation of violence by setting up special and ban in crime involved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="919"> The Presidency has therefore no answer to this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="920"> Next week in France, my invitation to a meeting of the European Conference, i.e. with the countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="921"> Do you believe that the model of Austria, namely bilateral decisions in the future will be an instrument for the European institutions and decisions and a new institution or a new to the unanimity in the Council to date? </SEG> 
<SEG id="922"> The Council was not dealt with this letter, but the Presidency has, of course, Mr President, the wording of this answer was all the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="923"> And what does it in the statement of Mr Cem - what the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici, not - its opinion after the in the further consideration of the partnership between Turkey and the European Union cannot be? </SEG> 
<SEG id="924"> We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco, far more than a simple agreement on the fishing agreements, and that this should not come, as he knows, a deterioration of the relations between the European Union and Morocco into your stand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="925"> Therefore, I must express my scepticism, what the result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="926"> With regard to the implementation of the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of Tampere, it is important to note that, for the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of individual rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="927"> The addition of other Members must be provided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="928"> In the Commission, in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 over the European Union, that the European Council a plan for energy savings and the diversification of sources will produce, will contribute to the efficiency, particularly in and in the transport to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="929"> In this spirit, we vote on the resolution concerning the ban in the framework of the third Committee of the general Assembly of the United Nations, on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities and with the international organizations to work together. </SEG> 
<SEG id="930"> It is a matter of NATO, the provisions to take the measures required for such not repeat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="931"> (the sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="932"> If money, it is now once the privilege of the money, quite clearly to define the political objectives, and the Commissioner has ever again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="933"> His visit can set a sign and the entire policy that we pursue a perspective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="934"> If we see in it a region, in the political conflicts are possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="935"> And the second demand of the two rapporteurs is raised and all of us must be to remove the consultation and information of the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="936"> The Heads of government of the determination of the Union, this process by means of technical and economic assistance to place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="937"> It was Parliament, that the Commission ’ s proposal for the creation of a European Agency for the reconstruction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="938"> As the House knows, we are considering an appropriate explicit reference in the regulation is not required. </SEG> 
<SEG id="939"> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="940"> For the cooperation, the participants agreed on, the work programme for the coming decade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="941"> I think that we in Europe, which we voted for Asia, and not only in terms of the economy and trade out at this point, it should be pointed out that the recovery of its economic situation, and the fact that we have kept our word and also in the last two years as the Asian exports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="942"> I think that was a very good political commitment, but we have some problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="943"> As is well known, seriously, and we support the Commission is also fully and entirely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="944"> It is necessary to improve existing Community legislation, in order to improve the security and the present dragging speed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="945"> Therefore, it should be the creation of new regional organizations and going to begin with, where there is already a partnership, as in the Western and Central Pacific. </SEG> 
<SEG id="946"> That is the precondition for a genuinely sustainable fisheries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="947"> I believe that the future of fishing in international waters of these organizations and all the efforts of the Commission, Mr Commissioner, nor to the attention of the UN, in both the UN here from new York to them, we need a very active in these organisations to favour a responsible fishing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="948"> Therefore, I believe that the Commission has a particularly important role to play in the Community for the cooperation they should request and propose, which we all agree. </SEG> 
<SEG id="949"> In addition, the Commission has also any great tasks in connection with the negotiations, in the context of the regional fisheries organisations must be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="950"> Mr President, I have the same problem, as Mr Nicholson, only much. </SEG> 
<SEG id="951"> So far, the proposals of the Committee on agriculture and rural development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="952"> Sometimes we even have already asked what the even perhaps by speculation of the problem is solved, in this way, the control of the sector according to their interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="953"> The additional, proposed in the report, is, in my view, unreasonable in a time in the agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement with Central and Eastern Europe, the reform of the agricultural policy is on the agenda. </SEG> 
<SEG id="954"> I consider it quite, which the rapporteur has left here, which shows what we can do with administration if a specific objective pursued, and it is clearly not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="955"> On the one hand the, which are those with instrument and keep to the systems and the systems of preference, over which you have already control,. </SEG> 
<SEG id="956"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Let me say from the outset that I, at the proposal of the Commission to establish a Fund, also in the sense of agriculture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="957"> I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="958"> The accounts for one wants a market for the intensive and a dismantling of agricultural policy, provided they are production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="959"> The pig it, and we should not make the mistake, the existing pig works in question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="960"> According to the Commission, it is justified only the farmers, the only to farmers, because this also because these income, while others do not join income. </SEG> 
<SEG id="961"> (the sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="962"> At the moment the value added tax and the traditional own resources, 15% of the total. </SEG> 
<SEG id="963"> Another part of the reform of the educational one from the Court area concerns the value and within a system of measurement and clearly defined, measurable targets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="964"> That is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, with the Members of the Court of Auditors, and also with the services of the Court of Auditors very sincerely to thank you for your report, with the reform of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="965"> I hope now that this proposal on the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, not just in Nice will not be swept under the carpet, but that one seriously. </SEG> 
<SEG id="966"> The reality, as described in the report, is the annual report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="967"> The number of errors is a highly as such. </SEG> 
<SEG id="968"> The amount of works and works was 240 million is too low. </SEG> 
<SEG id="969"> I cannot imagine the report of the Court of Auditors also introducing something through clear recommendations, for example one or two per application. </SEG> 
<SEG id="970"> In 1995, was an agreement on the protection of the financial interests of the communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="971"> The Commission and the Member States should, in this light, we and the results of the report as a tool for improving the management of the financial resources of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="972"> I am aware that this report and the work of the European Parliament within the framework of the standing of vigilance with regard to add. </SEG> 
<SEG id="973"> And now, Madam President, I would like to mention and waiting for someone to us by the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="974"> The Court of Auditors has just as in past years, no precise information about where the progress made, for the past mistakes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="975"> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union, and in the Court of Auditors' report is that it is also in the applicant countries, there is still a great deal to be done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="976"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have taken an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which, with the question of whether we have already previously completely for the secret, and to receive, and are also agreed that we preserve actually about. </SEG> 
<SEG id="977"> I would also like to address the Council and ask the question why the decision on Article 24 of the financial regulation is still outstanding. </SEG> 
<SEG id="978"> Perhaps some common sense from the European Union to the solution of the problem of the problem and its place in history, namely in! </SEG> 
<SEG id="979"> It is not our task to make, neither in our institutions, nor in our countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="980"> (en) I am happy about the fact that the Members of Parliament of the view that the situation with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report in Parliament and in the Committee for budgetary control than in previous years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="981"> However, we will have the opportunity to speak on all points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="982"> If it is, and we all facts must be named. </SEG> 
<SEG id="983"> Ladies and gentlemen, as you noted, the final part of the President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors by a virus in his report to this House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="984"> Some proposals as amendments Nos 1 and 18 are questions in connection with the above all political concern, and it must be noted that all representatives from the Socialist Party, the Party and the Greens, they defended, and they were adopted in the Committee on the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="985"> Mr President, we have in March this year, the directive on the passenger. </SEG> 
<SEG id="986"> We are of the opinion that in these trade not be burdened with may. </SEG> 
<SEG id="987"> We have voted for these proposals and for the resumption of the arguments of the industry, which were put forward in Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="988"> It should, if the general public information on the products, and this on the lack of information and documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="989"> In conclusion, a request to the European Commission to Article 4 concerning the European standards, and the question as to whether these reports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="990"> For by and arrangements, as well as the arrangements for on or from the usual sold from me. </SEG> 
<SEG id="991"> The reliability of the product and the customer the value of European in a special directive in a moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="992"> If we ask the Commission to call in the near future, to submit a proposal to the safety of services, so there is no reason why we the aspects of the services here now with rules for the proposal of the Commission, because it is already now that between the individual regulations will occur and that the risk in the course of time will increase. </SEG> 
<SEG id="993"> I would like to briefly the main points of this proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="994"> We now also the system for third countries, especially for the candidate countries: we have the procedures for the execution of measures at Community level, so that we, after the recommendation of a regulatory Committee is active. </SEG> 
<SEG id="995"> This new regulation will these countries, no substantial additional responsibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="996"> The proposal in amendment 11, to replace the word "by" by "to replace would not create but rather to create confusion, because the directive no definition of the term". </SEG> 
<SEG id="997"> The Commission, namely the rapid establishment of such a network, but must be between the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="998"> Such a certification can be consulted as it does, however, no 100% safety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="999"> I have explained why the Commission proposals 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33, 36 and a part of amendment 7, as well as the second part of amendment no 2 and the first part of amendment no 12 and 15, the Commission approves, however, the proposals 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35, and part of amendment no 7, the first part of amendment no 20 and the second part of the proposals, and, since the present proposal by the Commission, these proposals will be improved and more clarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1000"> Obviously one may view of Mr Poettering as Socialist of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1001"> According to my proposal that exists between 12 and 37 no contradiction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1002"> With regard to the sequence I, and I remember, however, that I in any case against all three proposals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1003"> The EU countries have in terms of economic development, certainly with particularly serious problems there are tensions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1004"> What the respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, so in the sense of a harmonised European instruments for Europe, for the treatment of the financial instruments for financial support to all those young people who, according to a professional or study in the European countries in their country of origin, in order to obtain receive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1005"> I would like to emphasize a factor which I really decisive in this regard: the lack of equality in the labour market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1006"> (PT), but Nevertheless still has the Commission now the programme for the support of the Community framework strategy for equality between women and men from the earlier programmes and, above all, by the end of this framework programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1007"> On the one hand, some by my Group were demanding, and, on the other, on the situation of women in the national and the lack of access to the insurance for we us with data. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1008"> (en) my Party has serious reservations about the application of the law on the sale of consumer instead of the application of the concept of the mutual recognition of standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1009"> Now one understands it, and offer the guarantee that the countries which are excluded from the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1010"> The proposal of the Commission Finally free hand in the language in the Agency, which we believe is a very worrying development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1011"> The simplification of the facility (not only in Pristina, what its separation of Yugoslavia) and the solution to the problem of dual structure with board and as positive measures in the direction of the considerable administrative system within the European Agency for reconstruction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1012"> We are therefore voting against the proposal of the Commission and the Parliament's report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1013"> An adaptation of the existing Community legislation in this area can therefore be regarded as legitimate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1014"> Furthermore, offers the possibility that, in the form of cofinancing by the Member States more or less hidden State AIDS. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1015"> (El) despite its serious concerns the Morillon report clearly going further than the Commission's proposal for the partnership between the European Union and Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1016"> We have voted against it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1017"> We must, as well as the rapporteur, acknowledge the progress that Turkey has made progress in some areas, and that positive signals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1018"> Our Parliament has already since 1987 this recognition, and the adoption of this proposal is a means for the Parliament in this issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1019"> The European Union must submit more concrete proposals and the extension to Turkey as an indispensable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1020"> Such reservations are Europe and not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1021"> For several years, may I as a Member of the delegation for relations with Canada, the operation of a regional organisations, the organisation for the North Atlantic fisheries), to which the countries of this region, including Canada, and all those who, in this region, some other benefits, such as France, Spain and other European countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1022"> It is only then that, if their own under the banner its fishery. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1023"> The recent is therefore not the Commission, to satisfy the European position, what a conversion completely disagree. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1024"> We were after negotiations achieved a result which deserves to be defended. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1025"> With this proposal, on the substitution of three directives on the guidelines for the quality of the air, water and health, to improve the issues in connection with the incineration and co-incineration and especially the emission of furanen and heavy metals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1026"> It seems important to refer to the reform that is now no longer only of emissions into the air, but also into the water and the soil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1027"> While the treatment is the draft has been improved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1028"> The introduction of the Mediterranean in new front, such as, for example, is a step forward, a stimulus to the reduction of emissions and, even if the proposed standards, not just the most modern technology. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1029"> Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise, especially you, Mr Blokland, that I myself a couple of Minutes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1030"> In conclusion I would like to say that this directive is an essential contribution to reducing the negative consequences for the environment and the risks for human health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1031"> It would be unfortunate if the European Parliament when it in the name of democracy, and under the responsibility of the individual the introduction of a system of new impetus on the concrete implementation of the essential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1032"> From country to country, however, differences, and there is a lack of information and comparable statistical data, information and give information about how the best results and, for this reason, etc., precisely for this reason, in the name of the Committee for economic and monetary and currency of the Commission before the general rules for the Committee and a Green, in all the relevant information compiled and evaluated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1033"> So far, this was a taboo subject. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1034"> The risk that not all healthy and and older people because of their high risk only privately and is for the not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1035"> The second concept, that of the rapporteur in his introduction, and that of many colleagues, following the necessary regulations and codes of conduct for the introduction of the mutual acceptance of the provision of high-quality, the provision of high-quality and discriminatory practices and a customer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1036"> In my opinion, it cannot be right that money is, who on the above. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1037"> The new proposal of the Committee on employment and social Affairs is right, a stock in the form of a first and then to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1038"> In the Netherlands, is currently on the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1039"> On this basis, the Commission should take the initiative and, as guidelines for the health systems of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1040"> A solution, therefore, for the insurance probably not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1041"> Therefore, I feel we should Mr Rocard on his report, in which he led the Commission to present a service, a book, which makes us an insight into the current State of the regulations in the Member States and, at the same time, the guidelines for the future, and the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1042"> Both are based on a: the State, the operational and the sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1043"> With regard to the European Union already has the specific regulations, the basis of a proposal for a directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1044"> (en) Mr President, I would like to congratulate him on his report and to congratulate him on his report, and also Mr Marinos, I should like to congratulate the opinion of its Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1045"> This study can be the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament in the initiatives or measures proposed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1046"> With regard to the budget proposals submitted, I can announce delighted that they have been fulfilled. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1047"> We have agreed to the programme, to which one of the measures in the areas of health, education and measures in the areas of health and education and to others, as well as the participation of that as well, but also of the person concerned itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1048"> This means that we must use the cyclical phases, a balance or to create. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1049"> Here I just remind you that the last Ecofin Council has asked the Commission, from the coming year just these long-term aspect concerns in relation to the ageing of the population in the assessment of developments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1050"> One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands, the Council - as I said at the beginning - the impact of the ageing of the population on the coming years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1051"> Therefore the accounts for the year 2000 in Germany a half points of the gross domestic product. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1052"> We still take the euro to the dollar, we have a clear negative effect in terms of inflation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1053"> Furthermore, a levy, and they are obviously also with the creation of a specific discrimination, the long-term investment and perhaps in the solution of the problem of the ageing of the population, are helpful. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1054"> This is the third principle leading us, namely the precautionary principle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1055"> It must be remembered that currently several proposals for legislation to be debated, all the efficiency and the joint regulations, and Consequently, as I hope, the confidence of consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1056"> But this relatively low incidence is no reason for complacency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1057"> To be honest, I was that in yesterday by Prime Minister Jospin which was not part of the Community in recent years was not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1058"> Obviously requires the appearance of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1059"> The office of the Commission, what the priority action against BSE is concerned, the controls in the Member States have now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1060"> What its safety is concerned, I would like to repeat that it is already a whole series of controls, the guarantee that meat and bone meal in the transmission of BSE poses no danger. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1061"> Yes, one does it think it, it has taken four years to agree a, I voted for the protection of public health as basic points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1062"> Mr President, I specifically that the Council Finally its opinion to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1063"> In the current situation is the only the circulation of infection, the use of meat and bone meal in the ban. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1064"> In this context, I would like to mention that we in the Liberal Group submitted a proposal which I hope will be adopted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1065"> The policy must here in the really responsible for this crisis in the duty, and with this a first step towards the completion of this dramatic crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1066"> They must therefore. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1067"> The labelling for beef, with it for two and a half months in force, no the origin of the animals, and that we have specified risk material is far too late. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1068"> The citizens must be extensively about the characteristics of the test. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1069"> Mr President, when you have nothing or almost nothing, as well as their colleagues in the face of the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, or the contaminated blood products are the reason was, as it was as a reason not to panic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1070"> The ban will be a massive effect, but the proposal on this is limited. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1071"> The consumers have lost their confidence, and this phenomenon must be obligatory for cattle and sheep. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1072"> Even now, rather, in the spirit of the Commission's proposal to work, that the highest safety standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1073"> Otherwise, I am - once again - fully agrees with what our colleague, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs said. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1074"> For once, the Council and the Commission, you have control over an adequate financial basis, and now a vigorous policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1075"> We must tackle this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1076"> Madam President, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I am very pleased to be here in this Chamber, that the CAP at any price. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1077"> We have control over the climate and the required not to and not genetically to replace, and yet we have the right, on our own for the feeding of animals and the Commission are required here, while at the same time we finance, for this reason, our Group has submitted a, in which the Council and the Commission called for possibilities to look around in Europe, the Annex this necessary to increase again a suitable substitute for prionenhaltiges meal and American genetically find soya. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1078"> The foodstuffs, the safe food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1079"> I find it example that France itself in addition to venture to take this step. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1080"> But you are not helping! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1081"> Therefore, I am astonished that, under these circumstances utilized still processed or. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1082"> Recently, in Britain to BSE. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1083"> I would like the European Commission, the precautionary principle in beef and beef products from France. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1084"> We still have no certainty and must therefore know how the scientific facts, and what measures are required. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1085"> In addition, I have all proposals for knowledge, for which I am thoroughly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1086"> If that come from the Member States and to me, the legislation would not or not, in practice, then we may think again about that, but not because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because it is in the European Union at the compliance with the law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1087"> If one does not want to hear us, then one us at all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1088"> The Commission is of the opinion that the one for the economy and the coordination of these measures will have an important role to play, and also the negotiations to the first of the partnership with Russia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1089"> The proposals which the Commission has, on the basis of Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1090"> (the President cut off the speaker.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1091"> The aim in this period was the decline of the reaching of a higher interest rates and a higher growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1092"> I always say that the euro on 1 January 2002, we have it in our pocket; we have it in, but we support it in our pocket. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1093"> The current limit values for nitrogen and lead were not also not the way in accordance with directive 92 / 72 / EC, it was noticed that the aforementioned were undertaken in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1094"> Subject: State aid for the audiovisual sector on a seminar on the subject of a representative of the Presidency, the Directorate-General for competition, the European Commission is of the opinion that the imposed legal investment alone, that they were prescribed by the legislator, State AIDS represent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1095"> It is to be respected and protected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1096"> But that does not happen, because this is a new growth and can, as we in the USA for a decade of continued uncertainty, exclusion, poverty and the appearances. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1097"> The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition, which is something to simply and meaningless. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1098"> In the climate emerging at the same time, there are more and more people cannot keep out and excluded. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1099"> Mr President, in this House, we very often a social model, as the European social model and the social market economy, that of the United States of America, as opposed to that of the United States of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1100"> (technical) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1101"> This is an enormous amount of money. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1102"> In addition, all political levels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1103"> I agree that it is necessary to know the causes of poverty better, I fear, and by means of concrete measures and in the social partners, local and national authorities and the joint action of the citizens against exclusion as a result of as a result of relocation of companies, and strong settlement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1104"> We had a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1105"> This is a legal problem, since in the wording of the Treaty, not only on social exclusion and poverty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1106"> These proposals are, I think, a pragmatic response to your request. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1107"> But, consent to the strategy is not necessarily approval. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1108"> If we are to have a clear, binding framework for the Member States, should define the different systems, which should have a longer time proof. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1109"> The renewable energies will be the solution of this problem, but nobody doubts that they contribute, and also, and also to the diversification of energy sources and to the reduction of our oil and gas, and on the other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1110"> I want to reiterate three of our demands. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1111"> The determination of the confidence of the citizens in the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1112"> In my eyes, a consistent policy in the area of renewable energies a symbol for the future of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1113"> With these agreements, including the Member States of the European Union to demonstrate that they make a contribution towards achieving the Kyoto objectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1114"> It would be unfortunate if one is excluded from the waste of energy can contribute, be it for small projects or as part of the total. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1115"> The development of peat in the assimilation and other vegetable biomass. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1116"> Mr Chichester, I would like to inform and before my coast on sea already installed very modern wind, it is a project that certainly very soon will be in operation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1117"> The dispute over the phasing-out of nuclear power, including Sweden and Germany, has shown that alternatives to and to be carried out at the debate in the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1118"> Therefore the Member States set binding targets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1119"> Therefore, I am optimistic that the potential of renewable sources of energy, provided the right incentives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1120"> I think it only a very much for the renewable energy also and, as they deserve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1121"> A very rise of us not with told the problems with our from fossil sources of employment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1122"> Consequently we cannot accept amendment 28. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1123"> However, the very fact that the terms used no intervention in their initiative and that they are not incompatible with the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1124"> In the Commission for the reconstruction where 25 000 live, was under 26 participants merely a woman. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1125"> Although the proportion of Maastricht was, studies have shown that the presence of women in the peace, the UN to an improvement in relations with the place and the public morals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1126"> The report goes in this area very detailed and also in which we in the Group of the European people 's Party and European Democrats, in the sense of an official document. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1127"> In political terms, I can support the proposal is rather than tactical defeat or tactical suggest a substance compromise measure, and that should actually be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1128"> They were imprisoned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1129"> Portugal, where women are not only after the 1974 access to diplomacy, has received with and our Ambassador in Indonesia, Mrs Gomes, proven, as the role of a woman and its capacity for the problems and the suffering of a people, the 25 years later in his battle solely within the whole world and especially here in the European Parliament are perceived. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1130"> So far, this only very few of them, two or three, as I hear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1131"> Therefore, in the future too, to be considered in the policy of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1132"> Unfortunately not defined, and there will be no way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1133"> To the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1134"> They are people with other experiences of generosity, for the leadership and in particular for the settlement of conflicts are indispensable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1135"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1136"> Secondly: if the sector is to be legally regulated, some points must be investigated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1137"> In the last few weeks I have established that, on both sides, as well as international trade unions in certain national interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1138"> The second objection, then they are also a? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1139"> All those who are currently work did, then a work under the social conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1140"> Moreover, this project already in line together. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1141"> We were just in a plenary during the first October, when we, in our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia by the courageous reaction of the Serbian people, whereupon we, as you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, the abolition of international sanctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1142"> So has the vitality of Europe in the world and the formation of that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1143"> There must be no doubt that the issue of the status of Kosovo is a question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1144"> On the other hand we would like a chance to prove that we are out of its own power and in recognition of the principles of democracy, the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro to develop within Yugoslavia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1145"> I must say that I - as I have with you spoke - and transparency, as it was in this extremely difficult situation and how they were committed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1146"> This will be in the Minutes in order to dispel Mr Watson. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1147"> Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions and the citizens, and to the environment and to more effectiveness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1148"> The important proposal is, in my view, to the reporting, above all on the documents must remain or at least still secret. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1149"> This issue is, and it is to that also regulations, I remain in force, and among other things to this point, we have tabled proposals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1150"> The Committee for foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, the proposal document or automatically and as a whole, to exempt. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1151"> If we want the citizens of their rights on notice that we need in these places of refuge specially trained staff who seeking citizen in the regulation and, as a scout through the complicated maze of the institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1152"> Registers are indispensable if we do not want that out of the insider-public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1153"> It is very gratifying that Parliament has managed to a broad majority for more transparency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1154"> Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their very good work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1155"> Mr President, I would like to openness and transparency in the European Union are in a good light. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1156"> If this is the case, then that is a disappointment, because it is all about the credibility and the European Union in the eyes of the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1157"> Under the document on the different things nowadays, and we want a comprehensive access to many in various forms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1158"> Mr President, the attitude of the Commission to the right of access to documents is clear from the internal manual on 11 October at the employed in the Commission and in which they are informed about how they it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1159"> This regulation must be at least. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1160"> The type of international cooperation with the diplomatic habits and rules - for example, that everything back doors, - not for modern, as they have been developed by the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1161"> We should not with the role of the European Parliament or with interinstitutional agreements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1162"> It was a step forward for the use of the right to information and knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1163"> However, it is not the only one, which I would like to express my thanks to a large thanks also Hanja Maij-Weggen of the PPE-DE Group, on the basis of the report on account of the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1164"> The transparency must indeed to a pillar of the entire European Union, but does the right to be able to take on, for the realisation of the transparency does not in itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1165"> The European Parliament asks that the European security and defence policy in the future in the structures of the European Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1166"> As President Prodi on 3 October, the Parliament, he spoke of the institutional triangle and pointed out that in a on controls and the common interest of the European system of each institution, the common interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1167"> I must admit that the great challenge in this regulation, the precise definition of the documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1168"> I would like to emphasise that the Commission given moment virtually the whole of the proposals as part of the, as no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1169"> In some cases I would like for the proposals of the Commission, and for the Members of the list with the Commission and with the Commission, which they do not want in the regulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1170"> Resources of credit institutions </SEG> 
<SEG id="1171"> Finally, and this was the most controversial point, demanded of the Committee itself an accelerated procedure for the implementation of this legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1172"> These are the result of a number of other proposals in the report, in the vote, with the now by the new labour government, which are the result of this consensus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1173"> Mr President, in view of the result of the vote for this report, and the response of the Commission this morning is quite obviously - if you consider all parts on which we have agreed - that we in accordance with Article 69 (2), the vote on the draft legislative resolution and should, with the Commission and the Council in its negotiations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1174"> Mr President, I am sorry to have said, that the Group of the European people 's Party and European Democrats (PPE-DE) the postponement of the vote, but I must point out that your coordinator came to me to tell me that it is up to the November II part-session meeting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1175"> I would, for a different reason a postponement of the vote, Mr Goebbels already said it - this is a very important issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1176"> I do not know what a roll-call vote costs, but there are certainly some thousand francs or Belgian francs from our budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1177"> I know that in France there were slaughtered, and this does not seem to be the best solution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1178"> Removal of animal feedingstuffs, and indeed not only for cattle and sheep, but also for pigs and fish, </SEG> 
<SEG id="1179"> That is not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1180"> Such regulations would be likely to restore the confidence of the consumers and the farmers and to make them, we want. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1181"> It is urgently necessary to go further - and a policy of the common agricultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1182"> The ban on the use of meat and bone meal as animal feed is merely the first step on this path. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1183"> We regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our Group proposals were not adopted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1184"> In my opinion, to lower the in the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1185"> In conclusion, Let me stress once again that the overall distribution of us may not bring us with the production of such way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1186"> If, for example, and not so low that it is for the arms are not enough to be less poor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1187"> The report refers to the resources in the amount of EUR 100 million for a period of five years to the reduction of poverty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1188"> The proposal, a second, in the area of the affected areas, the guidelines and national action plans will have my support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1189"> The report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators for the social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1190"> With the presentation of its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission comes to the request of the Council, "until June 2000" a "initiative for the cooperation in this area '. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1191"> Mr President, I have a very specific reason: with this report and, after which I had hoped for and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1192"> I hope that this system in all the documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1193"> Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and not my approval. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1194"> It must also be better succeed publicly known. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1195"> Yet the environment in a liberalized market that contribute to a cleaner energy, while for the other everything in the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1196"> The next item is the joint debate on the following: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1197"> It is easier for the following three reasons: Firstly, does this proposal to the consolidation of democracy and the demand for respect for human rights, especially with regard to the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1198"> In this debate, we, as the previous speaker rightly said, the solidarity and support of our institution of the Central American Parliament and this is happening at a time when we are committing the European Union to the countries enjoy a priority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1199"> I have no reservations regarding human rights, our colleague and friend, Mr Seguro, President of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico was said. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1200"> Finally, the Commission also in the dialogue with the authorities on the meaning of the regional integration as an instrument for the development and consolidation of the democratisation process in this area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1201"> Looking at the power to, he has not, the absurd debate about the "," a wave of xenophobia: on the other, the work on the ground or the very many of which for many years on ivorischem ground live and work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1202"> Requirement for the production of a genuine democracy in Côte d'Ivoire, the installation of an investigation on the crimes committed and the observance of human rights and of internal peace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1203"> Some believe that democracy is relative importance where Africa is concerned, this complex process, and one should the time for its work on the other hand, I am of the opinion that there can be no compromise with regard to democracy and that in Côte d'Ivoire today, the same question, as for example in Guinea, where one knows that people arrested and there is no democratic system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1204"> In conclusion, Let me say one more thing: dictatorships are only possible because it peoples who live in misery, who have no access to knowledge and many have. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1205"> It would not be illogical if the European Union today, new, at this time, all candidates participate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1206"> In very many parts of Africa, we are dealing with very different ethnic and religious mixtures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1207"> In these elections must be of political parties, which were excluded, so, even if only partially, the inadequacy of this first choice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1208"> The situation in Burma </SEG> 
<SEG id="1209"> It is an offensive against the and the Karen and how the, there are no indications of a dialogue between sdpc and the NLD. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1210"> Therefore, we confirm once again the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and of the Council in this direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1211"> I hope that the European Parliament by the treatment of this issue in the topical and urgent debate the Burmese people a clear signal that its desperate situation, not forgetting that we acknowledge that the situation in Burma is worse rather than better, and that we are determined to do something about it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1212"> This has been a long time coming. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1213"> Just in Asia, the danger exists that economic and political reforms in that it economic progress and the State under the rule of law and without the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that, without an operating under the rule of law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1214"> Mr President, I can agree with the previous speakers in many key points, for much of what happens today in Vietnam is not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1215"> The human rights organisation human rights watch, Mr Swoboda, mean that we just in the question of human rights in last time, in order to improve the situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1216"> These strictly confidential documents lead us a rare view behind the scenes of the politics of the Vietnamese government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1217"> However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation, just over a dialogue between the opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities can be achieved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1218"> There is also a clear pressure on the part of the producers in the direction of a of the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1219"> The next item is the joint debate on the following: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1220"> We also need the help and support of the EU, not only in England, but in all the areas concerned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1221"> I ask you all to support our resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1222"> It is imperative that the European Union is not something extraordinary measures after the entry of disasters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1223"> In this context, the Commission has taken two initiatives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1224"> Mr President, it is a purely linguistic errors with one of the proposals in the joint resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1225"> The vote to postpone the mandate to the Commission to move. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1226"> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1227"> The report is the statement that an increasing proportion of the sick in Europe through uncovered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1228"> I find it somewhat strange that the Commission is now already for a Green book wants, but at the same time a book about the present State of the regulations and the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1229"> In view of the fact that the proportion of people at the least important, it is important that the improvement of health for the people in the whole of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1230"> We cannot go along with that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1231"> Mr President, I am much concern for an accelerated procedure in the implementation of the results of the revision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1232"> What is the feeling of urgency that Mrs Villiers nor on that of the Commission of the need, in the adoption of the measures in an accelerated procedure, that is to say that the rapporteur herself, that this regulation no impact on the anti-competitive practices, which have, unfortunately, in the United States are spread. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1233"> We must also take care that, in addition, that the banks by equity capital are still a second disadvantage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1234"> Having said that, I would like to point out that the participants, in my opinion, also as satisfactory, the extension of these regulations is that the issues in connection with the risk that lies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1235"> These are some of the initial thoughts about how we, within the current rules of the Treaty, a process which would achieve verifiable and efficiently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1236"> So now is the moment in particular that the institution of the 'European' enough is enough for sufficient evidence has given that it has its own budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1237"> The PPE-DE Group fully supports the view of the Committee on constitutional Affairs that the authority should be expanded, the sooner the better, in particular with regard to Article 3 of the resolution of 1994. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1238"> A subject, but it is important for the citizens and to know that he or she as access to files can receive remain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1239"> Evidence of this report was to export the Ombudsman on the Commission, in its recommendation to the papers to its citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1240"> We think that the attitude of the institutions of the Union, and in fact all procedures, with maximum openness and transparency that should go to any suspicion of incompetence, injustice or for the administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1241"> I am referring, for example, regarding the demand for the incontrovertible proof of a test. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1242"> Colleague Bösch has already said on the proposals to the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1243"> After I have two requests to the Commission and to the organisation of the Commission, I have had and detailed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1244"> So processes open and transparent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1245"> Firstly, with the President of the Commission, carried out by the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1246"> It was clearly July 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1247"> Votes </SEG> 
<SEG id="1248"> (Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1249"> In the assessment of the directive on the resources of credit to include in the conflicting interests be balanced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1250"> So the idea of a European police College for the Member States of the European Union and for the candidate countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1251"> This is also the rapporteur, and the European people's Party, it also. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1252"> The social situation in most Member States of the European Union should now actually unconditionally cooperation between the different police. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1253"> Most of the speakers from it, that the integrated as a single seat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1254"> The preliminary not, however, with the Council for usually our Parliament a little present. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1255"> The rapporteur would like also provision of services, innovation and the limits of the knowledge and the protection of internal security in the spirit of the maintenance of public order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1256"> The were the ideal, the us, and saw the country for which they caused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1257"> A levelling down of standards in several Member States of the European Union, I would welcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1258"> Since the first in this issue, at the initiative of the European Parliament on the plane, the Commission and the Member States, with the aim of building an action on the way to get something on which we, as the European Union, on the State of the respect of the rights and freedoms of the citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1259"> This is planning a development of the police Academy in first and foremost at Intergovernmental level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1260"> For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1261"> - (SV) I voted against the establishment of the European police Academy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1262"> There is no doubt that many of our very slowly and work, and it is very difficult, in these issues to a swift action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1263"> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since they are the priority and not for children of separated parents and unmarried applies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1264"> My mother has such a separation and divorce and 85 years and they concern that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1265"> Therefore, I would like to inform the House that the Commission in the action programme on the mutual recognition of decisions - which I hope will be adopted by the end of the year - the extension of the scope and so that this regulation on the Supreme and priority for it without difference for married couples with children, as well as for children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1266"> We shall now proceed to the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1267"> This is the sport - it must be said - closely associated with other industries, for example with companies of the audiovisual sector, or the advertising and sale. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1268"> What we need is a flexible, flexible interpretation of the current regulations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1269"> Strictly speaking, it is an attack on democracy, so much, we also defend the things this wait to see. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1270"> The Commission is therefore in an answer to your request for information on the planned by the British government measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1271"> The proposal was, in connection with a preliminary half a year before the total in spring 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1272"> Also, I think, what Mr Simpson said, in an extraordinary way helped us in view of the probable and the government of the United Kingdom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1273"> By traffic, we lose a lot of time, not only are not only high costs, but that is just for the environment, a very great problem, and that is why I believe that if the British government actually uses the money for the problems to solve, then all have something, in particular all the citizens of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1274"> We are more or less the only in the European Union and yet the petrol and diesel by all the countries of Europe - for we pay in the United Kingdom for a diesel. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1275"> That concludes this item. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1276"> The European Parliament has a duty to assure them that it stands at its side, and I would ask you to observe a minute 's silence, our solidarity and our express. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1277"> Madam President, I would like to support this proposal fully and entirely, those which would have applied this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1278"> We are a good. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1279"> The EU is its relationship with the groups and as quickly as possible with the new government in the USA in contact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1280"> In view of this, what a surprise on the report by Mr Prescott over the deal, which he himself negotiated, I cannot understand why he not only of Mrs Voynet, but, as far as I am concerned - and this is my last question to the Commissioner, even by almost all the other European Ministers was rejected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1281"> Now there is a risk that we lost the momentum, the American position, and we may begin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1282"> The forests were this time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1283"> A steady would have for some countries to the result that parts of its territory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1284"> They have a high level of prosperity and low prices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1285"> I congratulate Mrs Wallström to its efforts in the Hague and wish its success. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1286"> Certainly, it was better to come to any agreement as to a bad, because the American proposal was insufficient and for Europe that acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1287"> Have the countries far-reaching consequences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1288"> I would like to repeat it in English: forest from carbon sinks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1289"> Only if the European Union remains, it can in the discussions and the measures on the "B" in Bonn, the initiative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1290"> We must give our own assessment of the events and documents, to work with the different parties and the "umbrella-group" in contact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1291"> The answer is the step following the COP6 or the continuation of the agreement that the agreement is ratified then in the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1292"> The European Council will we, i.e. Pierre Moscovici and I, at the meeting at another level, to which I, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos Intergovernmental Conference, and on Monday, on the occasion of the meeting of the general Affairs Council is still a meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1293"> The minimum number of participating on down, while the possibility of a unanimous decision of the Council to demand the de facto veto, through a by. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1294"> One can already, but I must hold this fact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1295"> The European Council will also address the issue of the State of the Union and Consequently to deal with enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1296"> The European Council of Lisbon, with an innovative and competitive Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1297"> The consumer, for obvious reasons, on which I cannot go further needs a more European. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1298"> We must work on this unprecedented enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1299"> This is, in fact, the criterion on which we must end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1300"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1301"> Firstly, the procedures of the Community acquis and policy, which is our duty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1302"> We are very much the same, and we do not want that it only. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1303"> The text, however,; it can also be improved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1304"> I think it is out of the question that the question of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty simply from the table. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1305"> They do not want them again in the Treaties, which is proof that this text, this should be set aside. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1306"> In the report we agree with a common unpleasant occur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1307"> I think that in view of the but rather chances of the burden of the Intergovernmental Conference with a more complex and controversial subject not intelligent gambit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1308"> I appeal to the Presidency and to companies, so that this gap is closed, because it takes in mass. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1309"> For the Commission, has acquired a proposal be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1310"> Although with the previous Treaty certain progress regarding the extension of the formula could be obtained from the political decision to maintain unanimity on matters of social security, the reception and arbitrary and of cultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1311"> The fact that this issue is, is in itself a clear evidence of the failure of a policy for the strengthening of ties of mutual confidence between the countries of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1312"> That is the situation in which we in this for months, because no one can be giving up. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1313"> The experiences of this year to get us to the statement that we may, after Nice, with a view to the future of Europe in the Union must not be achieved, or on the method, including between the representatives in the negotiations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1314"> The qualified majority rule so that Mr Prodi has quite rightly stated quite properly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1315"> This aspect in our debate today was not, however, is of great importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1316"> We have made it so, the extension of 1995 has before it came by Carlos Westendorp so so reflection Group, and now we have and we call on the same point, Mr President: we point to the institutional issues, without finding ourselves to an extremely demanding task, the debates on 27. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1317"> Let us not, the peoples of our Parliament, if it ends without result, also the large over our Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1318"> In the past, we have demonstrated that this is possible, and as a Member State, the profited from membership, I see an extended and peaceful Europe with great expectations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1319"> But if one even over a veto must be clear that this is also valid for all the others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1320"> However, a first transition in 2004 Parliament needed because some Member States before the election or during the period 2004-2009 to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1321"> Mr President, the issue of the reinforced cooperation and explained in this matter on a consensus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1322"> Mr President, at first sight it goes in Nice the and the, in view of the extension of the necessary adjustments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1323"> We had one ounce of that insofar as we on negative developments in our part of the world, less emphasis and positive passing processes in the foreground, then we, as it is presently the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1324"> We should not only the movement of goods, but also in services, investment, intellectual property and the competition in the majority of the Council and the Article 133 (1) of the Treaty, according to which countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1325"> An initiative of the European Parliament, but also in this highly sensitive issue of party-political and goal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1326"> We must therefore also be prepared, as one of you said when he on the American optimism and the way in which the Americans, by itself, which makes headway. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1327"> I would like to say that I think it is not a problem of the large and the small countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1328"> We have done a great deal, but we again on this old problem, and I do not believe that there is a development would enter, just because a single country moves, because what we have here, as I would like to repeat, with very strong national political, democratic in their countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1329"> Mr President, you stated that here, perhaps to a climate, and they also have a degree of pessimism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1330"> Moreover, I would like to ask you to make the requirements on appropriate manner, so that such an incident does not happen again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1331"> I believe that we arrange for which we have not yet reached that the guests of this Parliament in this House as guests and not a threat must have. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1332"> Here, hospitality and attention also there. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1333"> Thank you, Mr Tajani, Mr Tajani. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1334"> The best tribute we and his life, that it is to follow its message - Catalan, Basque, we all the dialogue in the Basque country a chance? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1335"> Not every can express his opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1336"> (B5-0549 / 2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy to the Council on the political situation and the humanitarian aid in Afghanistan; </SEG> 
<SEG id="1337"> When I speak of organisation, then, I think, too, that the European Union, the such great effort, also for the environment should get. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1338"> Secondly, they are in the resolution, the clear will of Parliament establish the security and defence policy, on two pillars: the civil and, in the case of failure on the military, with these two pillars each other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1339"> Mr President, in view of the already entered delay and the commitments which I still have today, I shall try to the contribution which I had prepared, something. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1340"> These relations are especially over between NATO and as well as between the European Union and the applicant countries and / or produced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1341"> As, for example, is on the events in the Balkans, of which one can say that every its role and responsibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1342"> In this period, we have the USA extensively about the developments in the framework of the European security and defence policy on the ongoing what is an indispensable condition is that you, as this is the case at the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1343"> The second annual report of the European Union over the rights which the European Parliament is concerned, and a forum on 13 December in Paris. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1344"> This policy, so that it does not become the Atlantic Alliance, which today, the basis of the collective defence of its Members, or a European army. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1345"> If the figure of 100 000 men all this does not mean that we laid down in Helsinki goal that we want, but about a reserve of different qualifications and so that ensured that the objective of the corresponding 60 000 men under all conditions can be achieved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1346"> Let me now in very brief words on the of a large part of our countries from our political sense this new task, with a very short of political influence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1347"> However, we are also faced with the problem that concerns that we, by strengthening the Liberal democracy in Europe is the continent as a whole, because that is what is at stake in the debates and the enlargement process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1348"> Three areas, we need a coherent whole cycle, the Member States and national measures of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1349"> Despite the complex procedures within the Commission, we have no 60 000 in order to achieve our goals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1350"> It must therefore urgently the aid must be found. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1351"> I do not agree, namely the to the claim that Europe gets a toy, so that Europe is, but it is true that the strike in various situations not immediately. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1352"> The EU should not have its own defence with troops. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1353"> To end, I would like the concern of my Group over the position in the situation in Afghanistan and the Commission and the Council to call, as far as is possible, their efforts for a peaceful solution and a aid for the population, especially now before the winter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1354"> In order words: where, when and how the European Union should in future be used? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1355"> The interview makes clear how the balance sheet of these two months Intifada came on injured persons and nearly 10 000 balance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1356"> That is why it is also a destruction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1357"> On the other hand, and in contrast to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible or that the European Union in the face of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East more than hitherto everything, especially now, during the period in which the USA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1358"> Mr President, in my speech, I would like on the report by Mrs Lalumière, would, in my view, very well and clearly worded. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1359"> But there is no political concept, and there is still no common foreign and security policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1360"> The EU has only one issue, namely that it is so far has not gained, although these essential sustainable and effective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1361"> A further point concerns the question of the allocation of appropriations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1362"> I express this, despite the huge assurances on this subject in recent days as chance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1363"> Our potential is still very. the Member States should consider their defence, which differ from country to country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1364"> Even those who are the benefits of the decision, for example, to the creation of the so-called army and its, must be the major political content of this resolution and its impact on the cohesion of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1365"> The first one and a Minister in our Parliament is strengthened, so that we will have the night reserved for the impression for our Members not to Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1366"> For all of these conflicts is a civilian better than a military action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1367"> Does France, in the long term, of an undemocratic regime? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1368"> Europe will not, therefore, a new, as some - as I believe - on the basis of that information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1369"> I have in accordance with rule 42 (5) of the resolution to wind up the debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1370"> In view of the four committees involved, which is why with the creation of the production report was applied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1371"> In the book proposed measures must, in its entirety, because the whole of the Commission, to modernise and become more effective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1372"> It would therefore be appropriate to reform the occasion to take your intervention on the areas to which do not contain any. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1373"> The occurred not only, but not only, but, above all, the cultural differences between the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1374"> The task of the new internal audit service, that you, Mr Kinnock, as for the reform directly responsible, is the analysis of the system within the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1375"> The cooperation has been launched, and I think the process, the Commission an important reform, which is for the future of the European Union is so crucial, and it has, since we always have helped. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1376"> They should be so that people in other European institutions, the national governments or in the private sector, but to work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1377"> Once again, therefore, our Committee on the importance of a strong, efficient, transparent and politically responsible Commission store. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1378"> As the Committee on Budgets, we are of the opinion that the establishment of the budget for based on account of the limits and because of our desire for strengthening the powers of the European Parliament as the real problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1379"> That is the clear will of this Parliament, together with the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1380"> Mr President, first of all I would like all four rapporteurs for the work they have done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1381"> It is in view of the fact that the EU itself of the modernisation of life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1382"> Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteur, to support the action of the Commission, it remains a fact that the recommendations of the Committee for a comprehensive and consistent response in the sense of striving towards a real government and not only after a better management of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1383"> The find its expression in a transparent administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1384"> In my opinion there are on the whole world no structure with a larger and, tomorrow, as the 15, 20 or more countries - an entire continent, the most part of the Union and in the Union and by you in the Commission on its structures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1385"> Reports are never easy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1386"> This was the Socialist Group, however, of the opinion that the management of the Community are right not to work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1387"> We know the outcome, and therefore the various Members of the Commission and its administration, detailed and with this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1388"> Thousands of already over a year, an evaluation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1389"> As we have seen in the debate, it is not so much about principles, objectives or administrative reform, but rather about procedures, technological, timetable or consequences in their implementation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1390"> First of all, I would like to inform the House that, as Mr van Hulten has already noted, on the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement was adopted, within the framework of an advisory Group 'rules for the things in public service "or, as in 1 of the book. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1391"> Mr van Hulten has picked up in the course of this debate to my knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1392"> The main aim of the revision is a simplification, transparency, the strengthening of the principles, that is, the special provision, less of the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1393"> It is also very uneconomic for the Commission, if the Treaties so expire, that cost X 20% to be replaced, costs 30% would be replaced, and then the evidence gathered and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1394"> The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on the reform of the European Union to the countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1395"> The latter, in particular the NGOs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1396"> Of course this is not sufficient, but we in any case against any of our aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1397"> We still have to come back to, because this is a framework. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1398"> Mr President, I am from Mozambique, where the European Union after the disaster, humanitarian aid, but once again, for which we have prepared the money placed, since not all signatures in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1399"> In view of this, a commitment and a higher efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1400"> We have now a harmonised system for the creation and for cooperation in all developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1401"> Besides, the establishment of SEM no solution for the remaining eight. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1402"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have very special emphasis today in this debate on the first year for maritime transport in the European Parliament, because they are going to be the first essential step, a first essential step in this area and which, unfortunately, by the latest events so much in the limelight of the public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1403"> That would, from a Presidency point of view, the report, with the Member States to decide on the basis of your proposals to reach an agreement in the Council, and the text at first reading, with a qualified majority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1404"> This rapid and effective action, whose result and six proposals are an enormous dynamism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1405"> The lesson, which this Parliament must take account of this morning, should the knowledge that the law of the sea in the world in a condition, and it is time that we bring it in order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1406"> On ships which do not meet the standards, must give a clear signal that we go in European waters in the European or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1407"> We have made a compromise between we are a compromise between the 5 000 tonnes of capacity, the limit value of 5 000, of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1408"> This data must the European, national and, as well as the interested to be provided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1409"> The grenzenübergreifende nature of the marine environment, that the question of a region in a region can, calls for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1410"> In the cooperation at local level will also be included. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1411"> The amendment of the directive in the sense of a strict application, a harmonisation of the legislation, particularly with regard to the selection of the ship and the scope of the different, is of course a positive measure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1412"> I would like once again to point out that the urgency of which you are sending, not given. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1413"> I think that, in the case of liability for the data between the Council and Parliament is once again, needs to be reviewed, regardless of what is being decided today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1414"> A tachograph, a black list, with all these things, we are entirely in agreement, but I would like you to a couple of points to make. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1415"> In view of this and of the catastrophic situation in Europe is the challenge, and eleven months after the wreck of the Erika, the European Union will be able to show a procedure, which was so, as none before. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1416"> On this, in which the Liberal logic in contradiction to a high level of safety in maritime transport. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1417"> What technical measures are also a source for the system will continue to exist as long as one in the zone and the exponential increase traffic based has not stopped. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1418"> The President-in-Office of the Council, it would, if he also create order in his country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1419"> Mr President, ever since the break-up of the Erika was under political pressure, a package of measures in order to the safety of vessels at sea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1420"> Greek ships will simply so that, without in the area, Mr Gayssot. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1421"> Thirdly, should then, when we talk about such dossiers, be clear that between our dependence on the one hand and the fact that we continue to use fossil fuels, no connection exists. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1422"> We should Finally the political courage to raise our ambitions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1423"> That, in this area, we have a very great responsibility and must, as it seems to me that any institutional aside. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1424"> For Finland, for example, it is of vital importance that Russia is included in this agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1425"> This concerns both the more stringent requirements for the construction of better rules for the port State control, as well as the regulations for the data, which is also a result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1426"> Mr President, today we are talking about the safety at sea, on the basis of three reports, for which I am the rapporteur may. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1427"> What the three new proposals to safety at sea is concerned, there is an urgent need to congratulate the three rapporteurs: they have in a very short time, which means that our Parliament is firmly committed to the new measures to increase maritime safety inspections and construction, and that in the near future disasters can no longer be accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1428"> Madam President, I had a series of disasters, above all with past heavily on our continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1429"> More than 80% of accidents are to a large extent, but for the reasons which are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1430"> Someone spoke of '". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1431"> With the directive on port State control should be the compliance with international standards, and no new directions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1432"> In the proposal, the port State control to the rest of the employment in relation to the implementation of the provisions on seafarers' hours of work, however, is covered by the existing directive 99 / 95. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1433"> I note with pleasure that the rapporteur in amendment 2 an indication of the system for the assessment of the conditions and with the proposed, and we are, however, still something to the wording to be allowed to make that clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1434"> Between 4 and the paragraph 'C' part in Community, are not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1435"> I can assure you that a, a ship with a ship such aims to make these its intention, as in power, consider should be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1436"> The Commissioner spoke for 18 Minutes and in this time of dozens and dozens of articles quoted and the position of the Commission report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1437"> Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a concerning the European network for the collection, the creation and distribution of the statistics of internally and good (EDICOM) (COM (1) - C5-0401 / 00 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee for the economy and the currency) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1438"> I therefore in the resolution, I would like, however, to express our Parliament to provide better and can, if it in view of the meeting of the European Council of Nice a specific and the European Council on the important and difficult questions asked, instead of it in the context of a single, all the other items on the agenda of the Summit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1439"> (more than twelve Members of their raised have taken into account the) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1440"> Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on the reform of the European Union to the countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1441"> I have that as a sign of protest, because the European Union in this area are still not in as much as it can. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1442"> Although neither the proposal to change the existing directive on port State control, nor the report nor the justice they contain some aspects pointing in the right direction, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted for the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1443"> It is therefore regrettable that the Commission proposal was not the idea of a real European authority following the model of the existing in the United States' ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1444"> The requirement for the safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment are the ship, stringent measures for the control of State of the ships, the harsh punishment against the security, the improvement of the working conditions of employment, education, as well as well as the demands on the list to be fair. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1445"> Unfortunately, the rapporteur Hatzidakis, the exact opposite. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1446"> The loss of the Erika in December, then the question of safety at sea on the political agenda of the Union, and the Commission has this text on which we are today, almost a year after the devastating loss have agreed on the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1447"> The present are insufficient e clear; this was only too clearly during the disaster of the industry, with the fishing industry compensated for their losses not sufficiently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1448"> Madam President, I had already, that I mentioned earlier. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1449"> The proposals of the rapporteur on harmonisation at European level, which can only be positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1450"> The area in question is very important, as it concerns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1451"> This would be rather a great success, because, on the eve of enlargement, we need not solely in the hierarchical and Europe, but a flexible, near Europe in which respect for the national democracies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1452"> The more strongly in the struggle between Member States view on compromises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1453"> In Nice, the most important task is to ensure that the institutions of the EU institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1454"> I see that in a week of hope! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1455"> I am also not for an automatic of qualified majority voting and codecision and also think here that any decision taken to extend from case to case must be met. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1456"> With the policy of Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the qualified majority voting in the Council, which currently apply to other areas such as education, health or education. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1457"> The right to influence, and in which, over the national sentiment and the governments and forget about its obligations vis-à-vis the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1458"> In addition, I have voted against a text, the result of the Charter of fundamental rights into the Treaty, which requires in Nice is adopted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1459"> It is a mistake in the European Union into two, I cannot, that a third of the Member States more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1460"> Its new role in the end, Sweden, Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1461"> In this report, there is much that the British Conservatives give its support for this applies above all to the emphasis on the enlargement of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1462"> The Danish social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report on the implementation of a common European security and defence policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1463"> But also against the peoples of the European Union, the new, on which the report refers, in any case, finance and which must not again have the guarantee that these are not one day in the name of the 'maintaining order "against you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1464"> Equally serious is the proposal that a country, at a would like, is obliged to make a financial contribution, among the countries involved at this is divided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1465"> With military means, of course, there is no solution, because they remove the cause of the conflict, but neither you nor a reversal in public opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1466"> That military operations from a line should be funded from the Community and the Member States for a financial contribution for such tasks should perform, even if they do not involve (49 and 50). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1467"> On the other hand, it would be good to the EU, if they are priorities, capital and more on civil and humanitarian. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1468"> I support this report by my colleague, Mrs Theorin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1469"> But the needs of this Group pushed forward the demand for the 'fiscal (n) "and the" adaptation of the prices and costs on the private ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1470"> It is incredible that we should, in the 21st century, nor should recommend that the Member States for domestic demand on insurance and pension. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1471"> For many threatens the first contact with the labour market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1472"> At worst, it is, if it is still women from distant countries, this work will have adopted and see no other, their livelihood. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1473"> The reform of the Commission will be assessed according to their results, hence the necessity of regular Commission during the entire duration and the importance for December 2002 balance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1474"> Not too long ago, it came as a result of weakness in 1999 for the resignation of the European Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1475"> Finally, I consider it absolutely essential to remember that this for the future reform of the same rigour and transparency of the Commission in its action, but also a part under strict its anticipated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1476"> The Conservatives the statement in paragraph 7 of the report, that the democratic control, and the system of the three pillars is to be made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1477"> (the sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1478"> We have received the information - and I want to immediately, I do not believe that the Council and tomorrow only 30 Minutes to speak. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1479"> Therefore, I welcome a I and opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1480"> We should in any case, and I personally to vote for a resolution such as this, Mr Lannoye, Mr Poettering and others have proposed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1481"> These texts, which in the night, which just for the Parliament in the Council and seats in Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1482"> Madam President, I would like to stress that this report de Roo not to remove from the agenda, because he is very well prepared to work on the last environment during the French Presidency, at the next Monday and Tuesday announced a common position. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1483"> Thank you very much, Mr Parish. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1484"> In the Committee for foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, its chairman, he also smoking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1485"> The political basis is clear: harmonisation of market under consideration of a high level of health protection and consumer, and indeed on existing and new scientific findings. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1486"> It is about their living conditions, which always significance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1487"> This rule, it can be applied to all drugs, however, to be applied, if no other port of these drugs person. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1488"> Just yesterday in the United States, the United States, with a conviction poisoning and details about the concerning products to end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1489"> Regarding the cigarettes in the EU for health are banned, but from the European Union exports, we take the view that the completion of this work is the only correct and logical. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1490"> Instead of pulling out of the defeat of 9 October of this year in Luxembourg, are we in a position, which is not legally. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1491"> I am quite precisely what the promised to Mr Hume said: "no job losses in this sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1492"> It is the Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and, amongst other things, for the correct legal basis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1493"> I do not believe that such a narrow path may, for that is substantial, as Mr Maaten and others, there is a risk that this Parliament, the Council and the institutions in their entirety, provided that this Parliament and the Council the leader of the European people's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's in the legislative work of the institutions, which are so important for the development of Community law, and is so important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1494"> Its weakness is the fact that the emphasis on the promotion of free competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1495"> The closure of the following: since the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Parliament is the protection of the environment and to coordinate and it is in this regard is with the Council and the Commission together. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1496"> In fact the fact has nothing to do with tobacco, but the decision of the European Court of justice have just as well, to a ban on advertising for alcohol or to a ban on advertising for chocolate, as is also sugar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1497"> I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament to introduce it as it is by the governments of the Member States is intended - those governments but also the many industries, pointed out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1498"> It is proved that 80% of smokers want, but the industry has to provide for these people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1499"> If we insist on other countries, what standards they should set by our proposals for the agricultural exports, so we must put the excellent work of Mr Maaten in question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1500"> We recommend the execution of this area in a country by a laboratory after an integrated method. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1501"> The effects of smoking on health are far away, and the legislator and have come to the conclusion that it is time to strict regulations and rules to this product. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1502"> The partnership, from this very well in the international regulations and therefore the risk of protection of consumer protection for the consumer and to guarantee a high level of public health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1503"> You should wait until the whole question of additives in the first report of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1504"> With regard to the proposal on the approval of tests, as in any other Article stipulates that only such were to be brought in to the provisions of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1505"> Madam President, this report is very clear: to the validity of guidelines for five years, five years on, then it Parliament once again to be produced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1506"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the regulation of which we today, I think it is a good proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1507"> I feel, therefore, that we in this House with this subject, not too long should stay, but the Member States, and also the regulation already extensively in the summer, and it is as part of our. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1508"> I am that the questions regarding the and the harmonization of regulations, as proposed in the power of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1509"> It would speak more for the end of September, about six months after its beginning to conclude. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1510"> We approve of the proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report, in 2007, as set out in Article 5. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1511"> It is clear that intervention in the human germ line cannot be accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1512"> We shall, if we agree with this compromise, a compromise which the therapeutic progress and the protection of patients in Europe not only so little, as it is, but improved, and that is why I voted for this compromise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1513"> These groups must also continue to fall within the scope of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1514"> I am happy, but also that it managed to us here is the road. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1515"> I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to reach a compromise in view of my report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1516"> These programmes involving the, the prevention of AIDS and the economics of the derogation would end the appropriate plans and the employment created networks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1517"> It is, to prepare the ground already in order to move ahead rapidly and, even if a second reading is needed, so far as possible, to the point at which a decision can be taken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1518"> Furthermore, we must consider that both the prevention and also, therefore, and therefore you meaning and a budget for that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1519"> Madam President, on the occasion of the report to the present European action in the area of public health, I would like my concern about the direction that this, in which the European policy in the area of public health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1520"> I have learned that the advice of its consent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1521"> In the European Union, now have the paradoxical situation that the internal borders, namely for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital were abolished, the 15, but even in the areas of police and justice in criminal matters are retained their removal from the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1522"> In conclusion remains that the initiative to hold a real and important progress in the creation of a European power if they also covers areas and in their effect, but it goes to the very many European citizens, they stood helplessly as if they outside the territory of their residence were victims of a crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1523"> What we demand for these? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1524"> At the same time, to ensure that the experts, the direct contacts to the victims the opportunity to get a specific training. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1525"> Victims must not only focus, Firstly, victims of crime and the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1526"> In this context, it is also important that the family of the victim, discretely and professional over the circumstance, should be informed, and also with the support of the people, and that they are not all learn from the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1527"> This applies to the type of crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1528"> We may at either national or European level ever of the principle that an individual responsibility for its own actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1529"> In other cases, the required information in a language of the Union, which is not their own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1530"> I am pleased about this first of Parliament on this important topic on such an important subject for the area of freedom, security and justice, we are building our protection in situations, which are often only. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1531"> Voting on the urgency </SEG> 
<SEG id="1532"> (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1533"> So we have agreed in the night from 23 to 24 November with the Council on the a brilliant, but certainly not the challenges of the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1534"> The Commission also had a revision of about EUR 300 million proposed by the Council itself with and on the other hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1535"> But I also know that it is that it is a difficult to formulate a mandate and to get the national egoisms in a sensible and decision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1536"> I hope that the work for a general office, as it on a European authority, too, so that we can make progress on the problems in the years on all the institutions - the Council, just as the Commission, the Parliament and the other institutions - namely the personnel of the coming years together. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1537"> The Council denied this revision - now we should actually already over the data '- and I would like to warn him: the two successive years - actually in less than ten months and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the financial perspective - in the financial, since it prevents its restoration of cumulation, up to a certain amount of 600 million is planned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1538"> This is the high requirement in the year 2001, can be financed in the amount of EUR 200 million to be financed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1539"> Under this new Council in second reading, the Council has adopted a budget, an increase of around 2.5%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1540"> Before you dismiss this budget, I would like to emphasise the value of the Council on the compliance with the attitude of some of the basic rule of resources in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1541"> And, in contrast to that, I believe, all three institutions - Parliament, Council and Commission - with the result which is right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1542"> Ladies and gentlemen, the sick and also for the immediate action, namely with the consumer, but also with the aid for the farmers concerned by this situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1543"> In the Council for the framework programme to support reconstruction in the Balkans an amount which, indeed, only a value, but with the financial perspective in line. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1544"> With democracy and we have, we still have a few million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1545"> My sincere thanks to Mrs Haug. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1546"> I think that this 1% of the budget of the European Union is very good. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1547"> If I have understood you correctly, you said that we not use the reserve, as against the rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1548"> I therefore believe that we have, apart from many others, that I now because of the time, not very good things. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1549"> While the expenditure almost the entire under letter also in the coming year, over 5% increase, the growth of only 3.5% of the entire budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1550"> We already have the great risk that in the years the discussion between the MEDA and the Balkans will increase, although we all know that there are urgently needed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1551"> Happy about the difficulties to which the path to the desired goal in Helsinki on the applicant countries may 1998, without the EU received, and that Europe into the State to continue to act efficiently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1552"> But it is progress has been achieved, real progress, even if they do not go so far as the Presidency - which, as I would like, or a great openness demonstrated -. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1553"> For the Statute of the European parties is a new legal basis, and that Parliament receives the right of complaint Article 230 of the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1554"> In recent months, three major steps forward. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1555"> This is the aim of the Commission regarding adopted in Nice and the fight to combat drugs on level to coordinate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1556"> The dangers - as is well known -. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1557"> In Nice, the European Union speaks for the determination and the introduction of a common foreign and security policy are used: a political and a Committee as well as a European and as a European. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1558"> For this cooperation, for their support and also for the us up thanks to you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1559"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1560"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1561"> Now we need the text in Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1562"> I would point out, incidentally, Mr President of the European Council, that the costs borne by the taxpayers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1563"> I regard it as a failure, not only in terms of the European Union ambitious objective, the institutions and the efficiency of the European Union, in order to improve the new Members to accept, but also in terms of a further important aim, perhaps too little was emphasized, namely in regard to the approach of the European Union and the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1564"> The right issues are, in our view, those of people, on the eve of the Summit from throughout Europe in Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1565"> First, the leaders in a as the fÃ were. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1566"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1567"> My Group is of this contract and about the future, it brings us, we are concerned with all the other hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1568"> Mr President, you have the floor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1569"> Finally, I would like to answer Mr Hager, that the instrument of cooperation in order to Europe is involved and the way as it now - I believe - Romano Prodi, and I emphasise this fully and entirely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1570"> Mr President, I would like to know whether the European Parliament for the time a new acquisition after Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1571"> The previously by the clinical pharmaceutical companies will perhaps by the Member States, as well as of our Parliament clearly expressed wishes to encourage the market for pediatric to develop medicines, even if this is not large enough for investments to ensure! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1572"> (FR) the regulation, the moment of savings and until 2001 was intended? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1573"> Do not always have the status of victims in criminal proceedings. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1574"> This European initiative will therefore benefit from the numerous. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1575"> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the President Prodi, among us, as well as the Presidency, and that in this, and that in this House, such an assessment of the results of the evaluation of the results of a Summit has shown. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1576"> The Europe which is in motion, is that, under the French Presidency in six months, as it seems to me that, despite all its work in crucial areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1577"> Above all, however, I am afraid that the UK, France and Germany now will be able, in the course of this last between the States and between the institutions sensitive balance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1578"> It is difficult to see how the decisions of the enlargement of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1579"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can today make it very shortly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1580"> For all this, I can only draw the conclusions that I, if the present Treaty of Nice should be voted, with no votes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1581"> Mr President, the most important result of that was that, in spite of everything, a Treaty came into being and now room for the candidate countries can be created. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1582"> The real winners of this Conference, the Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, the gentlemen, the "no" to Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1583"> Therefore we forget Nice and that we take our views on at me, my hope that of Belgium for its Presidency of a great European power, because it has proved itself: we must find new ways, we need a new method, we must accelerate the story, because 2004 is to lie in further distance, raises many dangers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1584"> Instead, the spirit of Nice apparent to ask itself how one can be able to celebrate the national interests instead of concerns, the European Union actually going. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1585"> Before we after Amsterdam and Nice, a Europe, a Europe of the national authorities, and not the Europe of the political agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1586"> In the essential issues, we cannot win on qualified majority voting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1587"> It is true that - here I am at the words of Mr Bayrou - since this morning, I sit here, first at the side of the President of the Republic, now in it, and of all the criticism, friendly criticisms, as it seems to me, but in any case criticisms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1588"> We must not forget that it was, in fact, the first time since 1957, is that this scheme actually was reformed or. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1589"> We have to do it with constitutional systems, and therefore cannot be mixed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1590"> Thank you, Minister. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1591"> But it is not included in the Treaties, there is still a mentioned in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1592"> Lastly, yet some positive aspects, such as the revision of Article 7 of the Treaty, the Article on political parties and their Parliament, the right of Parliament to the other institutions in Europe - an important factor of political control - the new formula for the European Commission, the incorporation of the so-called "," in the Treaty, the strengthening of the President and the new composition of the Commission, all of which represents a compromise which I accept and which certainly appropriate authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1593"> Mr President, we already have an uncompromising assessment of what happened in Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1594"> If we look at things: the Charter was not included, not even a reference. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1595"> We want the government proves that we do better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1596"> In spite of the Presidency this morning is the Intergovernmental Conference could not have been brought to a good conclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1597"> Mr President, it is not so easy, now the Presidency to criticise, since he is not here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1598"> Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the model of the Conference. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1599"> 2001 budget (continuation) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1600"> That is not, however, have not could do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1601"> The Commission set by the Commission, in the framework of a limited budget, and to do this, as any authority must do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1602"> With this debate next vote goes a long and complex process, the resolution on the budget of the European Union for the year 2001 to end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1603"> That is why we are as follows: as we go back to Article 272, we have avoided a crisis and the financial perspectives have been in use. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1604"> At the Council, I would like to say that in this game is not so quickly the dispersion and that we play so long, until we have the result obtained. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1605"> We do not want the resolution to wait for the opinion for the coming year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the Bank, but we share his criticism that a solution in terms of the financial category 4 in this way the 4 character of the great objectives of the external policies of the Union, and also the definition of the financial perspective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1606"> In order to achieve all of this, our long-term obligations must in future be set. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1607"> Only in this way is the money, the money for our citizens and for and rightly so. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1608"> If we take the opportunity to supplement, then it becomes almost 8%, while we are in all the other areas - be it the policy, be it the whole area of internal policy, including research, the administration, the past - a total of only a rate of 1.1%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1609"> Since the cooperation so well, we will have the opportunity in January, they have the opportunity to continue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1610"> Likewise, we welcome it if the still not regulated relations between Russia and the Baltic States criticism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1611"> With great interest, we pursue the social and development strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1612"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia, was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1613"> Even if President Putin us over the democratic development of his country, he is not automatically guarantee for a stable and democratic Russia, nor is the democratic fundamental reality in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1614"> We should not be there, but, rather, a Europe of economic cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1615"> As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr van Orden, right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1616"> Who, Moreover, and then in a few points from the country itself and of Russian interlocutors, or is in danger, in view of the country, which in its picture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1617"> In the political field, the joint strategy and, in a dialogue about politics and security and for a mechanism to create. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1618"> I would like to underline that we really make it clear that Russia is actually in a political Union with Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1619"> Are you, Mr Patten, prepared to support such a project? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1620"> As the honourable Members know, was the last Summit between the European Union and Russia of Romano Prodi a far-reaching dialogue on matters of energy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1621"> I very much hope that I, at the beginning of next year, will have the opportunity to visit Kaliningrad, and indeed, not only because there has spent his whole life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1622"> I congratulate the honourable Member, on an excellent report on an extremely important subject, which we have in the coming years here in Parliament certainly repeatedly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1623"> You put me in a very difficult situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1624"> Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is already very necessary, because the huge consequences and import of feedingstuffs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1625"> The Council has passed its struggle with Russia at all levels, expressed its concern, in particular, to the Russian government to excessive use of force and a possible extension of the conflict, to avoid, independent and effective investigations of the human, in providing the assistance and, Finally, with for the humanitarian aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1626"> Mr President, I am: it is also here in the House that questions in writing later. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1627"> (interruption from Mr Posselt) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1628"> This directive dates from 1992. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1629"> And, in this sense, we must work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1630"> These groups are, however, not in the new proposal has been accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1631"> The Presidency and some Member States have joined the European received through the proposal of the Commission to get it in its consultations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1632"> Question no 6 by (H-0886 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="1633"> First, I must say that the President-in-Office of the Council, in my opinion, the question of Mr Korakas has not yet answered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1634"> It is necessary to arrange this authority, and I believe that the European authorities are well aware of the problem and that we must make headway. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1635"> To put it in a nutshell, the representative of the Presidency, in this case, the Ambassador of France in Algeria, with Mr with Mr. met? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1636"> We welcome the proposed and, in this context, the preparation of the general strategy for the non-governmental organisations and to the special session in September 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1637"> The text on the partnership includes several references to the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1638"> As the Council vis-à-vis the European in its previous answer has already stated, the process of the mutual recognition of criminal judgments a better protection of the rights of individuals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1639"> I would like, however. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1640"> It, especially the political level and the use of a military use to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1641"> I would like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxes, whose harmonisation for the establishment and the functioning of the internal market is needed - as it says in Article 93 - and the principles - Article 94 - for Parliament, the directly to the establishment and the functioning of the common market and that, in addition to the direct taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1642"> I would like to say a few words to these three areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1643"> If the pattern of that in every against any remains part of this the for on regional cooperation changed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1644"> We also need the cooperation with Yugoslavia, and indeed a mutual cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1645"> Mr President, our Group fully supports the work of Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of the negotiation of a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1646"> Mr President, over the years, in which I was President of the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity - in their efforts to freedom and prosperity to accompany it, like other peoples of our continent, with its integration into the European institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1647"> On the basis of the development of this year, I am convinced that it has done, for precisely that Croatia in the months. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1648"> It is, in any case, the and the speed with which we have, in recent months on the development in Croatia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1649"> We are the people in Croatia, that you and your government in the coming years, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member that he recommends us the way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1650"> In this context, it is incomprehensible that, in this year of the Laskar Jihad on the Moluccas bodies, also where the law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1651"> On East Timor the militias which are voluntary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1652"> On behalf of the Committee on industry, external trade, research and energy, I would like to just three points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1653"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate on her excellent work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1654"> In this respect, there is no exception. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1655"> Continued violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh and Irian Jaya and great sorrow over the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1656"> Tomorrow, it will be here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1657"> Due to the messages from the Indonesian archipelago, however, the question of whether the situation is not yet more serious for President Wahid and whose combatants even, as described by the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1658"> If we want to help Indonesia, then we must start with money and actions words alone are not enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1659"> According to the report before us in this important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1660"> It is obvious that the difficulties of today, not tomorrow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1661"> Protection of the financial interests of the communities </SEG> 
<SEG id="1662"> The subsidies for its activity, especially in the construction and, in its time, must Finally be removed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1663"> The Commission must therefore through an internal reform, your announcement that they are not tolerated and any fraud will be followed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1664"> I think that must be the result of Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1665"> We welcome that negotiations between the Member States on the harmonisation of the legislation in the area, but we must support our countries any authority them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1666"> In addition, I would like to see the document of the Commission on this subject to one day after the Danish referendum on the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1667"> I have requested that these countries, notably because it is, in my opinion, at the time, you in the pillory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1668"> I am actually sure that OLAF is interested in the selection of higher. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1669"> We must, however, that we all concentration on the problems of the Commission not our own, but Nevertheless problems, we also have problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1670"> We try to fire and the smoke. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1671"> Nobody can understand, I too. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1672"> So that this objective is achieved in every respect, I would like to highlight four issues which, in my view, a role in the work of the authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1673"> For the Parliament itself, the problem lies in the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1674"> It is correct, if the Commission, Commissioner, when, on the question of the rights of the Members of which needs to be pointed out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1675"> He has the possibility for a certain period no question concerning the lines to approve, in particular those on the increase in the budget, the means used until further internal investigations. it can even request Members to request, in whose get serious problems have been identified - a type. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1676"> The report calls on the strategic thorough called lines and internal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1677"> Commissioner, in the transmission of information to the European Parliament and the interinstitutional agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1678"> The result of this common position, but, when it is not that we at the end, not only in relation to the proportion, but not even within Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1679"> I do not know why it should not succeed here, as with all the other directives, it is, at the end of a compromise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1680"> It is a proposal, of a long and, I fear, way, about some of the existing difficulties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1681"> The first proposal concerns Article 4, in which the issue of the supervisory authority for the supply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1682"> On the other hand, the proposal before us now confusion and a search for the legal jurisdiction as well as during the acceptance of a company right delicate moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1683"> In the United Kingdom itself in Committee by the voluntary code, it is a good example for that, as with an extremely complex matter, for the less well adopts a statutory regulation can be pragmatic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1684"> Far more important, however, is that we should not formulated in Lisbon, the task of creating a dynamic European economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1685"> It is for us here in the European Parliament, therefore, the board in, for example, of shareholders versus here in the European Parliament to regulate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1686"> By some submitted by the Parliament of the text of the Council's common position, as amended on points which could lead to, putting the directive is called for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1687"> It is not by any means that the proposed definition of a reasonable price is better than any other, because the different in the Member States at the present time are thoroughly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1688"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1689"> In addition is a awarded its within a period of up to three years in a professional experience, to bring in what sense because they over the art and books. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1690"> Consequently, there is the Austrian legislators demand and not to attack the European legislator, only the and houses and conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1691"> In addition, the subject we are dealing with, the need for a common position to even greater, because only such an it the European Union, at international level, in the interests of the interests of the worldwide. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1692"> I trust in the wisdom and the farsightedness of this House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1693"> So 1998 in Germany purely 274 of their rights, which had, with 40% of the sum and administrative fell. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1694"> In short, there is no need for harmonisation in this area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1695"> A similar proposal was already in first reading, has been rejected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1696"> It is assumed that the result of this right and difficult. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1697"> Only, we are now so that we do not, unfortunately, more and more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1698"> In the Committee, we have proposed a year ago. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1699"> Nature of this Parliament the so-called values and it will also continue to defend. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1700"> On the basis of the technological developments and the markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1701"> Since we find no reason to competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1702"> The reduction of the universal service, therefore, to bring the would be able to belong to a fair price for the entire population in all the regions more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1703"> I may remind colleagues of the Conservatives in this Parliament that, in the United Kingdom, to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1704"> Out of the network for the, we have a for these large companies in it, which is what you are still permitted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1705"> I am very pleased with this result, because one with the concept of the special services from the scope of the new technologies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1706"> Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, we cannot and will not tolerate this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1707"> The European Commission therefore for the second stage, the liberalization of the postal services. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1708"> Such a future I should like also to other countries of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1709"> Mr Bolkestein has recently in the press made a unliberale attitude was at least a newspaper. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1710"> This, some say that such a Fund to be set up and in which has taken, i.e. it could lead to the uncertain legal bases, its composition and the criteria in its application. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1711"> We will vote tomorrow, I hope, for the proposal of Mr Atkins or by Mr Sterckx, because otherwise, I am compelled to vote against this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1712"> Royal mail is at this competition and in my letters in Sweden. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1713"> What we have from the debate, or rather from the controversy, Commissioner Bolkestein, with its a liberalisation of the postal services in the first phase, and in violation of the rules laid down in this directive? we have learned that under the guise of progressive and concepts - how about modernisation, liberalisation or support technological upswing - the dismantling of the social stability of a country can conceal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1714"> The protection of the planned by the establishment of a Fund, on the private financing for the financing of the remote areas, and will probably not of existence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1715"> This and this to the fact that in the debate today, and must be confused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1716"> Madam President, in the discussion of this issue, we are talking about the economic and social cohesion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1717"> Madam President, Let me first of all, the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to congratulate him, because he, hard work and, with it, the balance between the different starting and to find their bearings. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1718"> I fear, the result will be that the current strengthen their position on costs the taxpayer yet further consolidate and expectations for something. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1719"> I am happy that our Liberal Party from other European countries, the position of the British Liberal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1720"> I consider the liberalisation in itself and the advantages for the consumer, which will result from it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1721"> Justified, because he is in the logic of the Treaties of the European Union, the completion of the internal market by the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment in the foreground. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1722"> The provision of such a service which forms the cornerstone of Community policy in this area, and all our activities are focused on the improvement of this service. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1723"> The special services are a further important area in which innovations and advanced technology. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1724"> He also said that he is the entire postal until the end of this decade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1725"> I stand up for one, that the obligation to provide a universal rights and Finally also in future is guaranteed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1726"> For this reason I can and does not stand idly by when the future of this sector is at stake, as the us all in Lisbon, were not properly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1727"> Thank you very much, Mr Simpson. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1728"> I would remind you, however, that the priority objective of this consists of a market for the Community market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1729"> Fortunately, we in the Committee on agriculture and rural development, where unanimity is sufficient for that I thank my colleagues and Mr Fernández Martín, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on development and cooperation for their support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1730"> For example, we must continue our concern because of the production in certain countries in the small countries and in some countries, which are the traditional countries on which we may have, we must not forget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1731"> Therefore, I ask that this report in its entirety, exactly the same as in the Committee on agriculture and rural development, of the Members of this Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1732"> Of the USA, which had been rejected, in the meantime, however, a solution with historic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1733"> Strong interests, especially the Americans, not even the funds are put in the American play a role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1734"> Sometimes, it seems as if the Commission with deregulation in trade and in the agricultural production in the international standard even further away from us as the Cairns Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1735"> Unfortunately, the Commission and the Council to insist on a solution to these interests seriously, especially after 2006. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1736"> In the various different, in other words, it is not that we said that we may no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1737"> The transition should therefore approximately ten years at least ten years through the guarantee a guarantee for the producers and the production of the regions in the Member States to decide what facilities for the institutions involved, there are produced market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1738"> I hope that you will now our arguments, because the Commission's proposed by the Commission, even if it is in reality the since the in such a procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1739"> Votes </SEG> 
<SEG id="1740"> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1741"> The Commission rejects the proposals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1742"> Before the vote: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1743"> (Parliament adopted the proposal) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1744"> Report (A5-0383 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on budgetary control on the reform of the methods and (2000 / 2008 (INI)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1745"> The most smokers are neither on the full nor about the consequences of their activities in that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1746"> I have myself in my long parliamentary life of 35 years now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1747"> I am afraid that this is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1748"> This is our last attempt by labels and results of the actual consequences of smoking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1749"> Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1750"> This is an assessment, I still voted for, and correctly., I have voted against the report in its entirety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1751"> The Committee for legal Affairs and the internal market is right when he on the rejection of the amount, which is not under 7% may lie. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1752"> With its vote against this directive, like my Group also has a political sign, as we in the European Union do not stay to develop. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1753"> Of course, the former Stalinist dictatorship must be condemned, but how can one Mr Putin also only the slightest confidence, the godfather of the Chechen people, this, the head of the opposition and civil society (unions, political parties) away like its own power? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1754"> Actually, and such an intensification of relations not particularly deserve, because in the last few years, the ruling of this country, not just by a high degree of democracy or passing, but we must also the Indonesian citizens in the eye, why we have this intensification of relations and this aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1755"> This mechanism may only deal with criminal offences were committed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1756"> (FR) the Theato report on the us the determination that the European Central Bank, and certainly to the much quoted a lead to agreement on the Bureau for deceit (OLAF) not considered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1757"> That concludes the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1758"> We must recognise that there are only two possibilities: either we want to, or we do not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1759"> Ladies and gentlemen, give us no cause for a change. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1760"> However, that is, however, an important element for the balance of the board, and that is an important basis, so that one can advance in the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1761"> Measures for the marketing of these are found in the national and regional programmes, to the development of the area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1762"> Europe and the United States are working with the defence of our common values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1763"> We will presumably also agreed on a new WTO round and on the effects of the numerous new bilateral on this over the next discussed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1764"> He pointed out that the transatlantic relations in the last ten years have been extended, and this on the American side, above all, the efforts of President Clinton to that is, I think, however, that in the one day, will also be noted that these new relations also Europe with the 1990 and with the transatlantic agenda, under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995 has made an important contribution, the success of these relations share. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1765"> Therefore, it is important to carry out a State of the transatlantic agenda for the year 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1766"> I would like to quote the statement by representatives of the Dominican Republic, to quote: "the WTO should an impartial, which provides that the common regulations are complied with and that the countries with which to do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1767"> Secondly, we care about the downfall of the Communist past, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union is only a single superpower, namely the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1768"> I know that he has a successful and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and the shots in these issues are involved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1769"> The next item is the joint debate on the following reports: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1770"> These objectives, and the main goals, will be the, at which the Commission has put forward concrete proposals must be judged. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1771"> What such a solution - that in only one country with which the provision of services in the Union as a whole - an avalanche in those countries with a lower taxation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1772"> At the same time not below 15%, but also the Member States, the right one or several of not less than 5% of beef, in this case, it is now planned arrangements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1773"> We requested the European Commission to, in order to guarantee that no exists and that the Council and Parliament to be kept informed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1774"> In short, the aim of this proposal is correct, but the method is to support and if we really want Europe want of our attempt to the correct signal for that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1775"> The demands for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, that we must all possible measures to take its limit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1776"> The only case, where the tax levied is if from a third country in the European Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1777"> The positive discrimination of air traffic must be completed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1778"> Companies from third countries are not taxed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1779"> Cds are not very ancient should be taxed, but Nevertheless, while over the Internet programmes of the tax should be released! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1780"> Nevertheless, the proposed solution as technically unworkable and as an obstacle for the development of the internet-transaction in the European Union, although we will have its expansion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1781"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the systems of the Union will be toothless and lose at. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1782"> Let us how we can promote the electronic and no new practices occur, Let us, as we will tax. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1783"> The Liberals, the principle of 'as little as possible, with the USA as an example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1784"> The simple rules must be implemented. </SEG>

<SEG id="1841"> Another important point that was brought in by us and the just in connection with the government will be essential, is that there are also mentioned by the rapporteur, yet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1842"> Since there are no common standards in the European Union, it is here, in a distortion of competition between the different Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1843"> So the of my colleague, Bernd long proposals submitted my judgement is so important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1844"> Mr President, first I must say that I welcome this report. </SEG>

<SEG id="1846"> We should be very carefully and then on two levels of combined approach of emission limits for the individual and, on the other side, the emissions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1847"> We need more time, and I regret that we have not had, even if the framework directive in general. </SEG>

<SEG id="1861"> However, this framework, but the Commission and the networks of the administrative arrangements for the development and implementation of measures in the area of sustainable urban development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1862"> The European Court of justice and the WTO are of the opinion that the precautionary principle in the environment or in the area of public health challenges can be isolated, even against the Europeans, as the procedure damaging consequences. </SEG>

<SEG id="1893"> Against a market which the most elementary human rights with feet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1894"> That would stand in contradiction to the respect for the national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty on European Union). </SEG>

<SEG id="1896"> Mr President, in the absence of other results that in Nice the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union disclosed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1897"> The joint resolution is far too much in this respect to unilaterally. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1898"> The delay in the written text - which is also now for four days, not yet officially - shows how difficult it is, in a general confusion were committed to Paper. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1899"> The only way to conflicts for the future to avoid, in the traditional is based on mutual respect for the national communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1900"> The Nice Summit is at last with an agreement to end the in a contract. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1901"> The resolution put to Nice does not reflect this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1902"> I would like to make a comment on social policy, the resolution in the presentation of its Presidency in and we have had, it is now next and, as regards content, in view of the existing problems and the great problems, as they are also of employees in Nice impressive was insufficient, with a handful of remained. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1903"> In the really important issues - as taxes, charges, social policy, asylum and immigration - is clearly everything in the old. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1904"> Impressive at the debate on Nice is the notion that the Treaty in the art, it is neither the Presidency itself in, instead of the Intergovernmental Conference and the reasons for that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1905"> On the contrary, the influence of national democracies, taking off, because the right of veto further, and the European Parliament more power. </SEG>

<SEG id="1910"> The question of the appropriations are here have already been said already said here: EUR 400 million are in fact only a minimum for the financing, and in the second half of the possibilities offered by the financing must be used, as described in the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1911"> So, in my opinion, not, as the report concerning the loss of European added value. </SEG>

<SEG id="1913"> If I now back in my own region, therefore, and find out that not a single last period these funds are used, I doubt whether we have been so effectively, as we must be in the future, so that we can welcome new Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1914"> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Helmuth Markov for his constructive and extremely competent to the draft for a communication on the innovative measures in the period 2000-2006 and pay tribute to him. </SEG>

<SEG id="1922"> As you all know, is the introduction of such over six months. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1923"> For the large groups as well as for their political means the demand for less State only that the State and its finances, including them should be available. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1924"> To this end, but even so, the industry and the jobs consolidated and the sector need security can be given on the 31 December 2000 and beyond, because the market is not equal, but by unfair competition and dumping. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1925"> The improvement of the capacity of the Commission, but in view of the EU by the Korean shipyards is not sufficiently accessible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1926"> The Council stressed that this competition within the EU. </SEG>

<SEG id="1933"> We are in the context of the trouble not entitled to make this answer publicly, though we say in what you said. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1934"> There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty, that is, this is the conflict between the Member States of the European Union. Gibraltar, but now the United Kingdom and contaminated by one part of the United Kingdom in another part of the country, without going to another Member State of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1935"> Spain needs only to the confidence of the people in the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1936"> Here we have a State, with the other Member States so that, as with any other country of the world, as if it years after the start of the European unification, as if the European solidarity would not have made the slightest progress. </SEG>

<SEG id="1939"> Based on the plan by the cuts in the budget stand for new, so that in the future to reckon with, in which defects technology for absolutely necessary repairs he service must be provided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1940"> The responsibility of the Community - how very much quite differently, extends, however, neither on the classification of to the execution of security, yet on the questions of technical safety of reactors or demands that a suitable must be brought to the repair elsewhere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1941"> In order to help them better to just one, the European Ombudsman, the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1942"> I call on the Commission, assistance for that as well in all its agreement with the NGOs that agreements. </SEG>
