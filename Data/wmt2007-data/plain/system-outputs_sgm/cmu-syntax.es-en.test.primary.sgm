I would like to pay tribute to the important and substantial intervention of President Prodi.
</seg>
<seg id=6>
As you know, this is a deliberate decision which took place in Amsterdam, to distinguish very well the two functions, the High Representative, unlike the Commission, is not independently, but has the task of coordinating the common foreign and security policy which fall within the competence of the Member States and in that case we must make it perhaps a broad area to the intergovernmental aspect.
</seg>
<seg id=7>
The way for the future has asked that the Presidency defined in Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=8>
In fact, we want to see more and better, but I think in all honesty that this is a good start.

Consequently, I am confident that the European Council in Nice associated with this project and decide starting specifically as a project, not as a fait accompli, after having adopted the reforms that we now need of course.

However, I have also indicated specifically on the basis of this we can achieve extremely important objectives with the Community method with which we have at present, for example, to better action in the Balkans.

Precisely in order to respond to the expectations of this pensioners who is called Giuseppe Italia and live in Cremona and to which I would like to sail in the Po, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the promotion and the development of seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals.
</seg>
<seg id=15>
- (DE) the outcome of the vote in this Parliament will make it impossible to achieve the objective of the directive, an objective recognised and all the speakers have been made and the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=16>
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I said during the debate before the vote, because I believe that the risk capital is important.
</seg>
<seg id=17>
My group colleague Armonie Bordes pointed out yesterday incisive that only a minority has an interest in the transfer of Community money and retirement pension contributions to the risks of employers.

<seg id=18>
Therefore, the Charter will above all to confirm the current practices, even a step backwards, the Member States, rather than represent progress.
</seg>
<seg id=19>
Mr President, at last we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen contains an article, Article 25, entirely devoted to the elderly.
</seg>
<seg id=20>
In principle this text may seem anodyne, because it contains basically existing rights, but if the Treaty is incorporated with binding force, as called for by the European Parliament, with the time would tend automatically to the standardisation of the national rights in Europe; would give a disproportionate to the Court of Justice; power would encourage greater centralisation on the European institutions, would limit the margin for decision autonomous of each nation.

Progress towards the accession of the 12 candidate countries
</seg>
<seg id=24>
In my opinion, several Member States have not understood until today the existence of this link and the hesitant progress of the Intergovernmental Conference can lead to major difficulties in carrying out the necessary enlargement in the deadline.
</seg>
<seg id=25>
We can only lead to in practice on a long-term basis all the points that I have said so far if the policy and leader of the candidate countries and the European Union - and here I agree with you, Commissioner - do know to the public that the enlargement of the European Union is beneficial in itself.
</seg>
<seg id=26>
This is the formula enshrined.
</seg>
<seg id=27>
Allow me to mention the second orientation according to which the presidency wishes to make progress during this six-month period the enlargement process.
</seg>
<seg id=28>
What I propose, therefore, is to work in this direction with the idea that we need to look at, from the point of view of the year 2003, which are candidates which could join in that date.
</seg>
<seg id=29>
I thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, on his wide-ranging and explanatory report, as well as the other rapporteurs.
</seg>
<seg id=30>
In these negotiations does not arise in no case "if..." , but "how" and "will" .
</seg>
<seg id=31>
But it is also have achieved because the prospect of becoming members of the European Union gives them hope in the solidarity of the European peoples and because this is required solid political and economic foundations.
</seg>
<seg id=32>
Several countries have been, with regard to the second criterion economic competitiveness in the internal market, very significant progress that has been very quickly to compliance with the requirements for membership.
</seg>
<seg id=33>
Therefore, we intend to coordination with the national governments, programmes of Parliament and other institutions is as close as possible.
</seg>
<seg id=34>
The accession is expected in every country with a great deal of concern the Commission' s opinion annually on its progress, this will go again shortly, on 8 November.
</seg>
<seg id=35>
We have chosen the principle of differentiation rightly, according to which each candidate country will be judged on its own merits.
</seg>
<seg id=36>
This debate is another opportunity to my political group to emphasise that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and also Cyprus and Malta, is the best guarantee for the future of all of us in Europe, in both the East and the West.
</seg>
<seg id=37>
It is a matter of the utmost importance, and in spite of this, interestingly, has raised the public attention.
</seg>
<seg id=38>
The people spent jokes by saying that after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, enlargement is still to five years.
</seg>
<seg id=39>
The next natural opportunity will be in connection with the following elections to the European Parliament of 2009, but we want to try to ensure that the greatest possible number of countries can join in 2004.
</seg>
<seg id=40>
In addition, they are six aspects of fund concerned about the method.
</seg>
<seg id=41>
In fact, we are, of course, in the very model of European integration, in other words, the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity, beyond the traditions or the specific features of each other, changing again in a trap.
</seg>
<seg id=42>
Your words have the support of the President of the Central Bank Hungarian: the European Union must give the appropriate signals, otherwise, Eastern Europe suspected or accused that Europe is not working seriously on enlargement, something which could lead to a dangerous disappointment on the promises of Brussels, and I quote the Hungarian spokesman.
</seg>
<seg id=43>
But matters must be made clear: there can be no accession on the cheap.
</seg>
<seg id=44>
This is an idea force which is also a big idea: we do not enlargements against the opinion, and the best way to make the enlargement with the opinion of its participation in elections, since the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of citizens' support for the political system.
</seg>
<seg id=45>
- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something briefly about the preconditions stage desired here by several parties.
</seg>
<seg id=46>
I would be very surprised if they were not this pressure.
</seg>
<seg id=47>
But I have already indicated that all countries are relatively quickly to the readiness for accession.
</seg>
<seg id=48>
This means that the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products sector is already agreed without the Poles have the concern that agriculture collapses.
</seg>
<seg id=49>
Efforts have been taken, but, in general, peace and trade have established stronger links between the citizens, now even more solid with monetary union.
</seg>
<seg id=50>
What must be the outcome of the negotiations.
</seg>
<seg id=51>
The only amendment that has been tabled is already covered in my report, but I welcome the fact that the group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants to stress the importance of equal treatment for citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=52>

Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, it is the biggest and most important, but, as we know, it is also the most problematic countries who are preparing to enter the European Union, so problematic voices to be heard on its possible exclusion from the first group of countries which will be included in the first place.
</seg>
<seg id=56>
Poland, the countries of Eastern Europe, the Communist countries that were we have too many unfulfilled promises.
</seg>
<seg id=57>
There is still a point that always arises when it comes to the Czech Republic is the problem of the Roma.
</seg>
<seg id=58>
Slovakia is not condemned to the second group, and it is obvious that I wish to join when they make the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id=59>
At the same time, I would like, in conclusion, to make a comment on the internal policy.
</seg>
<seg id=60>
Thirdly, and as far as agriculture is concerned, the level of productivity is even lower than that of the European Union, it is important to ensure the total opening up of the agricultural market to the necessary funds for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and marketing structures, as well as for the improvement of incomes.
</seg>
<seg id=61>
Bulgaria is waiting with bated breath to join in the European Union and NATO.

<seg id=62>
The acute poverty has been a fundamental problem of Romania since 1990 and the present government the economy, finally, is giving real signs of improvement.
</seg>
<seg id=63>
I hope that these matters become the priorities of the new Parliament will take up in a fortnight' s time, and the new government.
</seg>
<seg id=64>
But we note also that the definitive solution, just and lasting must fully respect the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is neither more nor less than the current international law, and the principles governing the European Union.

<seg id=65>
Malta in addition to a democratic stable institutions operate.

<seg id=66>
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.
</seg>
<seg id=67>
Must also apply, the European Community law is not only a law in the books, but must also be in the candidate countries a law in action.
</seg>
<seg id=68>
This transformation raises a tough demands on people in the candidate countries but ensures at the same time their future and the future of their children.
</seg>
<seg id=69>
Special attention must be paid - that I agree with the previous speaker - to the border regions.
</seg>
<seg id=70>
In this context, the Commission must not be left alone.
</seg>
<seg id=71>
The candidate countries want to achieve a rapid economic growth, if this takes place at the expense of a policy of nature protection previously established.
</seg>
<seg id=72>
We have a traffic backwards and forwards bad habits, many of them linked to health.
</seg>
<seg id=73>
Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united European continent.
</seg>
<seg id=74>
The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which is responsible in the domain of regional policy, transport and tourism and the trans-European networks, is aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various Community policies sectoral in favour of a global policy of town and country planning.
</seg>
<seg id=75>
But first I would like to make the point that the transport infrastructure will be of central importance for the success of enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=76>
- (DA) Mr President, I would like to join in the chorus of those who say that the forthcoming enlargement is the greatest task facing the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=77>
A great deal of pressure has been exerted on the traditional social values in Central and Eastern Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=78>
EL PPE does not want to impinge on the responsibilities of the candidates with regard to the pace of accession, because we cannot give a date for this.
</seg>
<seg id=79>
The second point is the mention of dates.
</seg>
<seg id=80>
There is also another reason.
</seg>
<seg id=81>
Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and the EU as a whole depend - this has shown Denmark - to a large extent, on reduce social and democratic deficits of European policy.
</seg>
<seg id=82>
The term populism is shameful that the technocrats attributed to the will of the people when it is expressed in a way that they do not.
</seg>
<seg id=83>
Ladies and gentlemen, have a pause to eat and relax. we are continuing to 21.00 noon.

<seg id=84>
In a longer-term perspective, there will be a single currency in the whole continent.

<seg id=85>
In these issues focus internal battles in each of the countries.
</seg>
<seg id=86>
We are inviting you to fight for a different Europe, of all the peoples, which has been got rid of all these inhumane characteristics, in which the people are masters of their fate develop relations of peace, freedom, fraternity, mutual beneficial cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id=87>
I have publicly praised the work of these organisations and, in particular, the challenge Romanian appeal which is based in Birmingham and other Irish organisations supported by many people, including Daniel or Donnell, artist of Irish varieties, which promised a million pounds and brought in that amount in Ireland and other parts of the world.
</seg>
<seg id=88>
The Nice Summit must provide clarity as to whether and how the EU will act on his part to be in a position to be extended in depth and in good time.
</seg>
<seg id=89>
The Poles are wondering: we will pay when we espouse or will we be second-class countries?
</seg>
<seg id=90>
I am sure that, with goodwill and with the help of the European Union, that it will be possible to find a solution to allow the two communities live in harmony and prosper as they have done for centuries.
</seg>
<seg id=91>
But we have also dealt with the issue of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including the linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.
</seg>
<seg id=92>
The requirement for membership is basically the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.
</seg>
<seg id=93>
We have talked about the benefits of enlargement, and this is one of the areas where Lithuania shows us the way.
</seg>
<seg id=94>
Imagine if we were all as them!
</seg>
<seg id=95>
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank and congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but, first of all, I should like to confine myself to Slovakia, more specifically, with regard to the political situation of minorities.
</seg>
<seg id=96>
I urge you to Nice determine a up to date when provide for conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries more advanced - without mentioning names.
</seg>
<seg id=97>
The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress for the entry into the Union and, of course, making the planning of this aid is even more decentralised.
</seg>
<seg id=98>
The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups in this Parliament, the government and civil society plays an important role in this regard and, as we have seen, also positive.
</seg>
<seg id=99>
We are ending up with the division of Europe into two, not by creating a new division.
</seg>
<seg id=100>
All this is contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and I would like to sincerely congratulate you on behalf of our group on this report.
</seg>
<seg id=101>
From this point of view, I believe that the issue of Cyprus is the most will determine Europe' s ability to see their political characteristics.
</seg>
<seg id=102>
I myself live near of the Baltic Sea, the situation concerns us all.
</seg>
<seg id=103>
The political vision remains the same.
</seg>
<seg id=104>
That is why I was very nice to hear Mr Klaus Hänsch, who has spoken on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, when the Commission wanted to pass a verdict about the consequences of enlargement, and also on the economic impact would be in the European Union must be enlarged.
</seg>
<seg id=105>
However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, that without transitional periods cannot operate in the interests of both parties and as a member of a border region which, like Mrs Schierhuber, has a farm agricultural close to the Czech border, it is very important to me that arise common economic areas more approximate without any major problems and that lead to positive results on both sides.
</seg>
<seg id=106>
As a Social Democrat I would like to emphasise three points.
</seg>
<seg id=107>
The EEA, in which they are including issues under the first pillar, will allow the access of the economies of the candidate countries to the internal market and will give young people and science the right to participate in exchange programmes, but on the other hand, will not force the EU to widen its agricultural subsidies regime to those countries in this way, the EEA Agreement would give a positive impetus, above all, to the economies of the candidate countries - very in need of growth to make their societies in a position to join - but also to the national economies of the EU, as it is estimated that, through the economic growth, could be cover even two thirds of the total costs of enlargement, and perhaps even more so if we come to the model of the EEA.
</seg>
<seg id=108>
Secondly, say not to the idea of big-bang of accept a large group of candidate countries at the same time, as that would run counter to the principle that the countries are accepted on its own merits.
</seg>
<seg id=109>
Thirdly, we must do everything in our power to prepare until 2003 to the European Union for the enlargement process within the meaning of the excellent speech by the President of the Prodi Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=110>
In this context, I would like to refer to the relationship between Parliament and the Council and point out that recently the Council responds with a great deal of ground to the written questions of Members.
</seg>
<seg id=111>
It is worrying that this is happening in a country which is going to join the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=112>
I would ask the referral back to committee for its preparation.
</seg>
<seg id=113>
- (SV) Mr President, today we are going to discuss and perhaps we will be voting three reports dealing with this matter, two of which are my.
</seg>
<seg id=114>
All those involved would benefit in the food chain.
</seg>
<seg id=115>
The safe food have a cost in the whole chain.
</seg>
<seg id=116>
We must therefore support Mrs Paulsen and the Commission, and adopt the principle of no-disolución, to give certainty to the animal feed and protect really to European consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=117>
The 1999 directive is a well thought out text and we can show some success, since you have managed to reduce the burden of demonstrable way.
</seg>
<seg id=118>
But simply admit the possibility of "dilute" products is not the solution.
</seg>
<seg id=119>
Very quickly, we have to insist on amendment No 37 on the dioxin.
</seg>
<seg id=120>
On this point, we agree.
</seg>
<seg id=121>
Therefore, the result is that, as European consumers, we will have to continue buying meat and milk and blood products produced in the world markets with feed which bear any relation to the thresholds and the limit values which we have established as the European Union, and a system of production of animal feed which is raw materials on the international markets, free of mixing any principle and wording before sell their products in the territory of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=122>
Before the second reading, we need to know the Commission' s view on how will the assessment of the risk factors.
</seg>
<seg id=123>
On the contrary, it would be unfortunate if they were adopted, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40, since that would mean that would disappear the possibility of the Member States to intervene promptly in the face of new dangers that are discovered.
</seg>
<seg id=124>
Consumer protection begins with animal feed, on the content of the feed, your statement and, finally, its administrative control.
</seg>
<seg id=125>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal feed deals with an important issue which, as all the important issues, raises many discrepancies.
</seg>
<seg id=126>
President, the discussion on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen had very emotional nuances in a few points, and I believe that, after the completion of this debate, we must assume that the requirements to the cattle feed industry are, of course, strict but then we can make the quality be amended by adding components.
</seg>
<seg id=127>
These three proposals addressed, individually and collectively, the serious shortcomings that the dioxin crisis has brought to light.
</seg>
<seg id=128>
Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of re-exporting to the regulatory posts country of origin.
</seg>
<seg id=129>
Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which seek to introduce the possibility of dilution under certain conditions of raw materials contaminated feed, are also unacceptable.
</seg>
<seg id=130>
That should be sufficient, bearing in mind our commitment to establish an early warning system covering the whole food chain and animal feed in the new proposal on the food authority.
</seg>
<seg id=131>
Commissioner Byrne, following this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs lies in the fund an old problem, in particular, the open declaration.
</seg>
<seg id=132>
This is a benefit that I have brought this morning' s sitting.
</seg>
<seg id=133>
If we do so, if we transponemos quickly and if we supplement quickly the codecision procedure, of course we will have gained a lot, and I am sure that we can maintain a very strong and unified position before the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=134>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the future too can happen again or at least it cannot be ruled out that was introduced in animal feed raw materials polluted.
</seg>
<seg id=135>
The BSE scandal was the most serious example and better known.
</seg>
<seg id=136>
Common sense, as our rapporteur said - it would be clearly have a label open, to present the list of ingredients.
</seg>
<seg id=137>
I believe that the technical qualifications and competence of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and rural development judge on issues relating to agriculture and also with the animal feed is indisputable from the point of view of the search for a solution with a practical guidance and practicable farmers and consumers concerned can apply and understand.
</seg>
<seg id=138>
So far the positive side.
</seg>
<seg id=139>
In my opinion, is a legitimate right to information must be satisfied.
</seg>
<seg id=140>
I would ask, Madam President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send our condolences to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Britain and Marín, Galicia, where are the majority of the victims.
</seg>
<seg id=141>
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
</seg>
<seg id=142>
Are there any objections to taking this oral amendment?
</seg>
<seg id=143>
That is just as the rapporteur has explained things.
</seg>
<seg id=144>
The majority of its technical proposals deserve to be supported enthusiastically, for example those relating to food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations in the first generation, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the essential code of conduct for companies in the West when working in the East, etc. the task is enormous, and also absolute priority.
</seg>
<seg id=145>
At the same time, the barriers to overcome are considerable, particularly in budgetary level.
</seg>
<seg id=146>
Enlargement to 28 countries not only change the geopolitical context of the European Union, but also change its structure, because the total population will increase (+%), but at the same time the number will "disadvantaged regions" .
</seg>
<seg id=147>
In this context, we must bear in mind that, because of its strong economic and social weight, agriculture and food industry competitive will have a decisive importance to the success of the process of transformation and restructuring of the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=148>
In this respect, I would like to see the outermost regions, which 6 out of every 7 are still in the group of the 10 poorest in the EU, benefit from the Structural Funds, not only on the basis of the single criterion of GDP, but also on the basis of geographical indicators, demographic and social above all.
</seg>
<seg id=149>
As we reject, for the sake of the French, we cannot in all conscience, adopt its enlargement to the countries and peoples to the east, only released from the communist dictatorship, which cannot yet know the trap technocratic and totalitarian who wish to fall.
</seg>
<seg id=150>
We should have be content with the national reports and, at most, a brief resolution, but full of content.
</seg>
<seg id=151>
The current system, with subsidies, aid and quotas must be replaced by free trade and the adaptation to the markets.
</seg>
<seg id=152>
The importance and the extent of the problems arising from enlargement are incompatible with the double language which it has been used within the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=153>
For me to talk in terms of enlargement does not recognise the membership or some countries does not belong to Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=154>
Our neighbouring country has worked with determination over the last ten years in order to comply with the criteria of accession.
</seg>
<seg id=155>
Latvia has a place in this Chamber, not only because overall, its progress give you the right to this "confidence" essential to complete a successful negotiation of this kind, but, above all, and above all, because in Europe is at home.
</seg>
<seg id=156>
Gawronski with this report, and I believe that Poland is the rule, among all those who have applied for membership, which deserves more than others our support, given that, without the very important initiatives of Poland, would not have fallen communism and we would be standing here today talking about this problem.

<seg id=157>
This may not be so clear for the population, which is still mainly eurosceptic.

If Romania continues to progress and the European Union adapted its institutional structure and its policies in order to cope with enlargement, I do not see any reason why that Romania should not be admitted to the Union.

Whatever solution is to take with regard to the settlers, and it is one of the difficult issues, together with the return of land on both sides, this is too hard, if we do not do some caveats.

Unfortunately, some of the points that the Committee on foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy discharged in the draft report on the request for accession of Cyprus to the European Union does not make matters easier.

Some important aspects of the regulation are: firstly, the regulation of the burden of proof.
</seg>
<seg id=172>
Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=173>
That is why we need legislation against discrimination.
</seg>
<seg id=174>
In part, as a result, we have before us a great deal of legal and technical amendments that seek to ensure a level of equal treatment against discrimination on the grounds of race, on the one hand, and on the grounds of religion, inability, age and sexual orientation, on the other hand.
</seg>
<seg id=175>
Had to make an effort of balance, moderation and good technical legal and his report reflects, in my view, these qualities.
</seg>
<seg id=176>
I also believe that the cases of discrimination are not as many as to incur a legislation.
</seg>
<seg id=177>
In the action programme there are not enough funds to replace this work taking place in the fifth framework programme and, hopefully, to take follow-up in all the other framework programmes, although we must ensure that they are compatible.
</seg>
<seg id=178>
Everyone agrees that we must fight against discrimination, but the opinions vary on how to do it, and to what extent and with what methods.
</seg>
<seg id=179>
I had an opportunity in the committee makes against the fact that experts could also be outside the NGOs and yet have things to say.
</seg>
<seg id=180>
We are also very satisfied with the provisions of the directive that makes it clear that equal treatment for disabled also means that is expected of companies to make adjustments in the workplace.
</seg>
<seg id=181>
The only way we will effectively combating discrimination in all the areas of human coexistence in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=182>
After all, as we learn from the anglosajonas great democracies, racism and discrimination are fighting with the liberal democracy and not with the restriction or the gradual erosion of the freedom of speech and freedom of expression, association and economic.
</seg>
<seg id=183>
We have a proposal which raises homosexuality in the same category as the Holy marriage.
</seg>
<seg id=184>
Strengthening the positions of the European Union to specific situations suffered by its inhabitants with regard to discrimination and equal treatment.
</seg>
<seg id=185>
I would also like to comment on the issue of religious exclusion.
</seg>
<seg id=186>
There are whom I expressed concern about the possible interpretation of the recitals relating to Article 1 that, once again, may seem unclear, but make a distinction between the sexual orientation and behaviour.
</seg>
<seg id=187>
So there is a hierarchy in discrimination.
</seg>
<seg id=188>
In New Caledonia preference is given on the basis cromática skin.
</seg>
<seg id=189>
The first positive element of the directive is the universal approach in which we conceive the treatment of discrimination, which is of particular importance if you want to have a proper implementation of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=190>
For those who come here to say that Europe must not include in a directive that we want to defend the values, confuse.
</seg>
<seg id=191>
We must not interfere in these achievements we reached with so many efforts.
</seg>
<seg id=192>
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task.
</seg>
<seg id=193>
Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative measures to combat discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.
</seg>
<seg id=194>
We must avoid red tape absurd, that the only thing that will be reduced to Europe to a purely materialistic entity, politically correct, but meaningless.
</seg>
<seg id=195>
I believe that this Parliament has accompanied as if it were a Christmas tree little advanced legislation that the Commission would have wanted to put on the table.
</seg>
<seg id=196>
I would like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, this excellent report.
</seg>
<seg id=197>
To accept the amendments that seek to highlight the importance of the prevention of and fight against discrimination.
</seg>
<seg id=198>
The second category is intended to clarify the text of the proposal of the Commission and the third covers a large number of amendments which seek to adapt this proposal to the race directive, adopted last June.
</seg>
<seg id=199>
In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose the removal of the reference to discrimination on the grounds of racial and ethnic origin.
</seg>
<seg id=200>
I cannot accept the references made by Parliament in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to the natural and legal persons, as well as the unofficial groupings, because this proposal on employment is only applicable to individuals.
</seg>
<seg id=201>
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
</seg>
<seg id=202>
We cannot expect a public support the establishment of peace operations, if our troops are to die as a result of shells from weapons which have provided ourselves.
</seg>
<seg id=203>
In my own country, in order to have a scatter-gun need a licence, but not for instalarme as seller of weapons in a cobertizo of my garden.
</seg>
<seg id=204>
Another important point is the ban on the export promotion and marketing of equipment and know-how used to inflict torture.
</seg>
<seg id=205>
Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate Mr Titley on his excellent report.
</seg>
<seg id=206>
We must extend our examination, on the one hand, in addition to the issues of legally binding, also to other aspects outside the strict equipment for military use, such as the disarmament and the increase in the effectiveness of the body of police and customs authorities, and then, on the other hand, to the applicant countries, as Mr Wiersma has just mentioned.
</seg>

<seg id=211>
Thank you, Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=212>
With regard to the problems of SMEs, of course we have seen that in the framework programme, SMEs are, as provided for in the budget decision.
</seg>
<seg id=213>
This is, at least, which seems to colegirse the debate on the budget in Greece, and the fact is that many invoke the views of the European Union. is that true?
</seg>
<seg id=214>
With regard to the pluridisciplinaridad, I share your view.
</seg>
<seg id=215>
The first is that specifically mentioned in his report EU participation in national programmes.
</seg>
<seg id=216>
It would not be possible to talk about European research area if we only represent 5% of this research.
</seg>
<seg id=217>
Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.
</seg>
<seg id=218>
On the one hand, and after the effort made to commit completely funds at the end of 1999, the Petitions body at the beginning of this year for the financing of new projects were necessarily very small.
</seg>
<seg id=219>
But I repeat that Portugal did well in the previous period, that I would like to point out, and I simply the figures for 26 September, is that the funds really committed by Portugal and for the new period (I am only Commissioner from a year ago) reach 2.6%.

Finally, the establishment of a high level of contributions uses and consumption on mineral oils does not lead to a no-cumplimiento of Community provisions on competition.
</seg>
<seg id=222>
Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, in cases where the Member States promote by means tax particular sector of industry, infringe the rules on state aid, in this case the fiscal aid state, which amounts to a subsidy.
</seg>
<seg id=223>
For example, nuclear energy is a very clear and appropriate case.
</seg>
<seg id=224>
Subject: budget line on minority languages budgetary resources that are available from the European Union since 1983 in favour of minority languages were a constant increase until 1995, in which reached their maximum amount, EUR 4 million.

- (DE) Mr President, the Members of this House I am sure you know that the Structural Funds - and this is new - spend a lot of resources for cultural activities, because I insisted, Michel Barnier, in that they are not only invest in roads and airports, but also in people.
</seg>
<seg id=226>
The Commission so that the next year is going to make new financial commitments in this regard.
</seg>
<seg id=227>
In relation to the specific financial proposal, it is not possible for me to take a position, because we must respect the normal procedures.
</seg>
<seg id=228>
- (SV) I have thought in many alternatives.
</seg>
<seg id=229>
And it is a reality that need to be tackled, because we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises in the whole of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=230>
The rules relating to the treatment of the game, for example of the elk, also apply to the meat used for their own use?
</seg>
<seg id=231>
If these rules are applied to the meat they are consuming hunters, it would mean a bureaucratic disaster for elk hunting.

When this report has been completed, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of inadequate compliance with the working time limits in the next few weeks.

The general product safety requires producers to provide information on the risks to consumers.

</seg>
<seg id=238>
The attitude of the EU on this ministerial meeting in Vientiane and if, in fact, must take place or at what level the EU must be represented in it will depend on the development of the situation in Burma by December.
</seg>
<seg id=239>
One final point.
</seg>
<seg id=240>
The elections are an important step for the people of Kosovo should be involved in the administration of their communities.
</seg>
<seg id=241>
I can tell you that the development of these elections has been more democratic, better than the elections in our own countries, in which on many occasions I have been involved or I was an observer.
</seg>
<seg id=242>
But we saw as a principle and not in any way, as the end of the process.
</seg>
<seg id=243>
She calls for a better and more closed control on the arms trade and for greater transparency.

Now I find that every year increase contracts for weapons and arms components.

We cannot take real decisions based on information and apparent realities.
</seg>
<seg id=246>
The provision that have been held together in the same DG should be subject to revision.
</seg>
<seg id=247>
Although these institutions should have the option to appoint an internal auditor, it is enough to impose certain minimum requirements of the Financial Controller audit.
</seg>
<seg id=248>
This proposal does not have the unanimous approval of this Parliament - as the Commissioner well knows.
</seg>
<seg id=249>
Therefore, we have no objection to the creation a independent internal audit service, to which we give the green light today with Mr van Hulten' s report.
</seg>
<seg id=250>
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur.
</seg>
<seg id=251>
In our view, the modernisation of the administration is urgently needed.
</seg>
<seg id=252>
An independent audit is essential to avoid mistakes.
</seg>
<seg id=253>
The money must be spent on the future of a more realistic way to the objectives and more effective, and, of course, must be guaranteed better than the funds be used for the purposes for which have been disbursed by the budgetary authority.
</seg>
<seg id=254>
With regard to the proposed amendments, I would like to point out very briefly: the Commission accepts the introduction of additional recital.
</seg>
<seg id=255>
Therefore, I would like to thank you for your proposals and their advice.
</seg>
<seg id=256>
I would like to sum up the proposals in this report which seem to me to be more important and specifically viable: firstly, the creation of a group of experts composed of figures recognised prestige, appointed by the Member States, in order to contribute to establish minimum parameters media protection of minors; secondly, the creation of a code of self-regulation between all operators in the sector; thirdly, the possibility of promoting and become accessible filter systems for television and the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id=257>
Unfortunately, I cannot endorse the demands of the Liberals.
</seg>
<seg id=258>
This is still basically task of the Member States' legislation, which does not exclude the possibility of an agreement, however, agreed at European level on certain indicative values, through dialogue with all the parties involved.
</seg>
<seg id=259>
However, and equality in other circumstances, I think that it is up to parents dissuade their children to see this type of programme at home.
</seg>
<seg id=260>
Parents need special support in this area, which must include the following: common parameters for the media protection of minors throughout the territory of the European Union; the installation and the availability of filter systems at affordable prices; legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media, companies and providers of public and private sectors.
</seg>
<seg id=261>
Then I am surprised, and that is a euphemism, to hear some say, during the debates in committee, that there is no proof the harmful influence which may have, on children, the television violence in all its forms.
</seg>
<seg id=262>
With regard to the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it should be noted, particularly from a technical point of view, that broadcasters in certain Member States have already introduced codes of adjustment for television screens that should allow parents cut off the flow.
</seg>
<seg id=263>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=264>
In particular, my report replaces the international valuable generalisations for a referral back, in fact, the decisions to the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=265>
This would be the least that give us this area of freedom is a fundamental right of every citizen of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=266>
There are even, Mr President, that things have not been paid since 1996.
</seg>
<seg id=267>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani, for the work he has done.
</seg>
<seg id=268>
I would recommend this report to the House and I would recommend support for the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.
</seg>
<seg id=269>
Our human resources are our only future in a world where knowledge is what it is.
</seg>
<seg id=270>
The problems are not resolved green papers, black or white red, but with a specific action.
</seg>
<seg id=271>
However, the European Parliament and its role, Parliament pressed for researchers were in spite of everything included in the text.
</seg>
<seg id=272>
Today we visit at a crucial time for the future of European integration.
</seg>
<seg id=273>
However, we know that the process has not completed its vitality and its inconclusión threat.
</seg>
<seg id=274>
If we do not say now, in this delicate and tumultuosa stage of the European and world history, when we will do so?
</seg>
<seg id=275>
None of us can pretend now know exactly when and with what sequence achieve these objectives, but we all know that believe in them and deseándolos fervently, we will have reached the halfway stage.
</seg>
<seg id=276>
We must ensure that women take advantage of the work induced, without at the same time to prevent the recurrence of the same inequalities in the more traditional sectors: less specialized jobs, part-time sometimes not elected, precarious contracts and difficulty of access to jobs direction.
</seg>
<seg id=277>
We will present to the Council a proposal for indicators to measure the progress made on this.
</seg>
<seg id=278>
Finally, in a nutshell, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reaffirms the integrated approach to equality with gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.
</seg>
<seg id=279>
I think more particularly in the violence suffered by them, one of the priority issues of my government action and that mobilises in particular, I know, ladies and gentlemen.
</seg>
<seg id=280>
We know that the measures reconciliation of family and professional life encourage particularly women, although we still do not have the necessary studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women play in the same, which is no longer the traditional, because that society has changed a great deal and, at the same time, the family structure.
</seg>
<seg id=281>
Sometimes, even colleagues in this Parliament believe that there are some, but this is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id=282>
I would like to end, Mr President, by saying that equality must begin in the home.
</seg>
<seg id=283>
This position seems to me to be embarrassing and ambiguous and deserves, I believe, Reflection for projects which are before us, because it is not certain that with all this desemboquemos in practice.
</seg>
<seg id=284>
In this area there is no equality.
</seg>
<seg id=285>
The image of the European Women, found throughout the pages of our report, our directives, does not square with these women Danish opponents mostly to the euro.
</seg>
<seg id=286>
In this respect, I think it significant that the report' s emphasis on achieving a balance numerical in all sectors of society, for example in the labour market.
</seg>
<seg id=287>
That is why it seems to me that an opportunity has been lost in this report because marriage and the family are completely marginalised.
</seg>
<seg id=288>
It is something that should also take account of the Committee on Women' s rights and equal opportunities!
</seg>
<seg id=289>
We have heard that the previous presidency of the Council first reestructuró the Ministry of Equal Opportunities for their country and then take it off.
</seg>
<seg id=290>
The media wages women are still below, on average, in almost 28% of men, which contributes to that women are the poor majority of the population and makes its participation in social and political life.
</seg>
<seg id=291>
This is excellent.
</seg>
<seg id=292>
We are now seeing in Europe the impoverishment of the employees and women in France, where 15% of them live, at the end of the day, with fewer than 3,650 French francs per month.
</seg>
<seg id=293>
Not all countries have managed to follow his example and I hope that the example of France end growing in other countries.
</seg>
<seg id=294>
Of course, the history of women is very long.
</seg>
<seg id=295>
We must help the truth candidate to be put to the level of the acquis communautaire.
</seg>
<seg id=296>
But need your help.
</seg>
<seg id=297>
Is not the case, but it is a text satisfactory and, on reflection at length and after a wide-ranging debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs chose not to table amendments.
</seg>
<seg id=298>
The Committee on Legal Affairs, after a long debate, understood that it was not sensible to keep the legal uncertainty for six years, three years, which is the term establishing, is a more reasonable term so that, with the appropriate means and a medium-sized diligence, be able to establish whether there have been or not irregularity in a statement.
</seg>
<seg id=299>
This is amendment No 15, relating to fraud.
</seg>
<seg id=300>
The objective of reaching above all to a simplified communication but high-quality sufficiently flexible legislation, an improvement in the procedure recaudatorio and with greater adapting the provisions in the field of customs procedures, responds to one of the requirements of the single market and has been achieved, to such an extent that even many countries have been based on it in order to participate quickly in international trade.
</seg>
<seg id=301>
Palacio Vallelersundi for the effort and the interest with which you have worked in the drafting of this report.
</seg>
<seg id=302>
Welcome

<seg id=303>
I hope that this does not change the outcome of the vote that will, but the truth is that we must verify the translation of the French version.
</seg>
<seg id=304>
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.
</seg>
<seg id=305>
It is recognised that knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition for mobility.
</seg>
<seg id=306>
We also believe that the Member States themselves should decide taxes who wish to implement.
</seg>
<seg id=307>
I regret that the much-needed proposal to introduce a period of limitation to retain the documentation for a limited period has not obtained a majority of the votes.
</seg>
<seg id=308>
During the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we welcome the inclusion of Article 13 on the discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or the sectarian philosophical beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation.
</seg>
<seg id=309>
My final point relates to the budget for this programme, that is to say EUR 98.4 billion, an amount which is, of course, inadequate for the actions planned.
</seg>
<seg id=310>
The arguments put forward in this amendment explicitly follows that its purpose is to intervene in the age provisions in force in the Member States, which are, however, perfectly justified on the grounds of psychological development and have no impact on the working life.
</seg>
<seg id=311>
In my opinion, also needless everything provided for in the new Article 12 (A).
</seg>
<seg id=312>
With regard to the belief or religion, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=313>
(SV) the Christian Democrats welcome proposal directive on equal in the workplace.

But this only says something of the staff of an internal audit service and nothing of the financial importance and usefulness of this service.

<seg id=315>
The EU has decided to put in place a common military capacity to meet the so-called Petersberg missions (The fight against the crisis and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU) and is not, however, a common defence policy.
</seg>
<seg id=316>
The world is safer without weapons.
</seg>
<seg id=317>
With this resolution is not to reduce radically arms sales to promote a policy of disarmament, but only regulate themselves to increasing the profits of industrial groups are concerned.
</seg>
<seg id=318>
The communication from the Commission recognises the problem but does not propose specific measures ofuscada because it is in the liberalisation of the market and of competitiveness, and that no proposal concerns the harsh reality, especially for children, the profligacy of multinational companies, which, in their pursuit of profit, ignore the impact of their programmes and products and move the whole responsibility parents, inviting them also to consume new products to protect their children.
</seg>
<seg id=319>
Like the rapporteur, I believe that measures to protect young people from the violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to the traditional television, but apply to all the media.
</seg>
<seg id=320>
With an average of three hours a day, it is the most important human activity after the dream and for adults, after the work.

On the other hand, women are often jobs "flexible" ; the temporary contracts or the low wages are typical of the sectors which used mainly women.

That continue to fall as first victims of cuts in public expenditure, privatisation in the field of health, the right to medical and pharmaceutical care - how much more the law on the prevention and information programmes.

Mr President, I would like instead to hold a debate on Latin America in connection with something urgent to discuss this issue following a well-considered discussion in the committees.

We must ensure that Peru reach the goal with candidates which are equal to the challenge and be able to respond to the demand of the Peruvian people renewal policy and a substantial democracy.

However, we know that Afghanistan is not far off, that Afghanistan is the largest producer world opiates and, therefore, we know and we can imagine the role played by these mafias policies, which are not only policies, in the expansion of trade in drugs.

B5-0794/2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit participant in the negotiations with the guerrillas;

Unfortunately, all we would like to speak in Colombia.
</seg>
<seg id=334>
The Commission has already shown its willingness to coordinate measures of this package. in the next few days will allocate substantial resources to this end.
</seg>
<seg id=335>
Therefore, once again, apply double standards here, and I believe that we must deplore.
</seg>
<seg id=336>
The attitude adopted by the Albanian opposition I find it particularly incomprehensible, which deliberately refuses to accept a solution essential intended to remedy an Albanian problem in Macedonia.
</seg>
<seg id=337>
It seems to me that it is rather strange that the Macedonians within their country will make mutual agreements.
</seg>
<seg id=338>
However, the government, which has shown an enormous value in seeking a solution to the problem University and many other issues, it needs clear positive signs and strong support, otherwise, the consequences for peace in the region can be harmful.

The PHARE resources earmarked for the year 2000 within the framework of the national programme can be used also to help the university during the next academic year, that is to say, the 2001-2002 course.
</seg>
<seg id=340>
I would like point out that today all the Greek Members to the European Parliament we have reacted in this situation.
</seg>
<seg id=341>
And as this concerns Greece, which has the greatest maritime sector throughout the European Union, basically concerns the safety of shipping in the Union as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id=342>
In recent years, in our own waters, many lives have been given the sea, not only in large ferry accidents but also all too often, between our fishing community.
</seg>
<seg id=343>
On the contrary, it exploits the innocent victims to promote the wider objectives of shipowners.
</seg>
<seg id=344>
We have to bear in mind that what we are trying to do here is the credibility of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=345>
Finally I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the problem of the European legal provisions on the safety of passenger ships must be one of the main concerns of the European Union, and that it is to ensure a strict and uniform application of the same throughout the Community.
</seg>
<seg id=346>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me for being somewhat late for reasons which you are very familiar, to make a very brief statement on the two issues that are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade, and in the ex-República of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id=347>
Commissioner Verheugen is going to speak, as Mr Solana has done, on the two issues before us this evening, that is to say the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.
</seg>
<seg id=348>
We must be prepared to comply with this promise in the respect the will of the people.
</seg>
<seg id=349>
Madam President, Mr high Representative, Commissioner, I am taking part in this debate with reservations, because it did not want to Parliament apareciese solely as a judge authorised to launch an anathema against this or that, at a time when, following the hopes so strongly encouraged here a month ago, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id=350>
Madam President, my speech today is not based on a number of distance analysis, but in my own experiences of last week, since by chance I was in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip when these disturbances took place there.

Although I am against all violence, cannot be treated with the same standards violence Israeli and Palestinian violence.

<seg id=352>
I would like to ask the Parliament, at this critical moment, to make a statement of support to the courageous today have stood up for freedom in the streets of Belgrade, echoing the support that we, as Europeans, not so many years ago we give to those people who in other capital also fighting for their freedom.
</seg>
<seg id=353>
Madam President, the Europeans would be without doubt very inspired if terms to the ball flight that we launched here the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
</seg>
<seg id=354>
The position of Jerusalem is the complicated issue in the negotiations.
</seg>
<seg id=355>
For years has managed to pull the wool over the eyes of the people of your country with its propaganda machinery and the brutal repression of the media and, unfortunately, has also managed to fob off many people of the Western world creating a false image of reality.
</seg>
<seg id=356>
While the tragedy concludes, it is the duty of this Parliament, as a symbol of the free and united Europe, support the mass around the Yugoslav parliament and help achieve Mr Kostuníca and carry out their mandate.
</seg>
<seg id=357>
Precisely its tough position makes us fear the worst at the same time - and current events reinforce these sentences were drafted a few hours ago.
</seg>
<seg id=358>
I wonder whether the Commissioner is already looking at the steps need to be taken in order to make it clear that we regard Kostunica really as the legitimate elected representative of the Serbian people, and as the real partner with whom the European Union wants to speak from today.
</seg>
<seg id=359>
The European Parliament would like to express its full solidarity at this historic moment in the tyranny wobbling and triumphs democracy.
</seg>
<seg id=360>
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237/2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending decision 2000/24/EC in order to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank loans for projects in Croatia (COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)).
</seg>
<seg id=361>
I welcome the new political direction was opened in that country, following the legislative and presidential elections.
</seg>
<seg id=362>
Between the Union and Croatia in office, among others, a group of advisers whose mission is to offer Croatia their experience and technical assistance within the framework of negotiations for the normalisation of relations agreements.
</seg>
<seg id=363>
Let us not forget that until recently, Croatia was a textbook example of a programme of privatisation completely failed, of which only have a few, this process must be supported in its entirety.
</seg>
<seg id=364>
The sum of EUR 250 million in the form of a loans from the European Investment Bank for the period 2000-2007, which we are debating will not be a milestone, but help and promotion.
</seg>
<seg id=365>
That is why it is not totally correct to speak on the report "democratisation" .
</seg>
<seg id=366>
When Croatia and Slovakia made a apparent independence for the first time, acted as servants of the Hitler regime.
</seg>
<seg id=367>
We could also, of course, have considered the issue of the guarantee request and the Croatian issue in the context of the debate yesterday evening and the situation in Belgrade.
</seg>
<seg id=368>
When it appears that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed, we hope that the actions to establish a partnership and a normal relationship between Serbia and this Union of democracies only be delayed a few days' time.

<seg id=369>
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.
</seg>
<seg id=370>
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
</seg>
<seg id=371>
My question is this: who is entitled to speak on behalf of the European Parliament on the Statute?
</seg>
<seg id=372>
I would ask you, Madam President, that you will be able to take every possible effort to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions on a letter of protest who have tabled more than thirty collective social and NGOs against this situation, in which blatantly has been breached the Community rules on radiation protection.
</seg>
<seg id=373>
A post-mortem examination to be carried out practised in Georgia has clearly shown that it was a murder with possible torture.
</seg>
<seg id=374>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an opportunity for us to take a major step towards our dream - which, by the way, I do not share.
</seg>
<seg id=375>
This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other rules on genetically modified plants.
</seg>
<seg id=376>
Of course, is a blunder to another.
</seg>
<seg id=377>
(The sitting was suspended at 17.40 p.m. and resumed at 17.50 p.m.)
</seg>
<seg id=378>
In accordance with the next item is the debate on the report (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council (COM(2000) 379 - 0508/2000 - 2000/2219(COS), the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the regions on the sociopolitical agenda.
</seg>
<seg id=379>
Thirdly, just one question: to stress the importance of this open method of coordination does not mean that this method will replace the social legislation, because we have to set the social rights in Europe too, we must have the courage to draw up minimum social standards and it is essential that there should be a social rules with a view to the internal European market.
</seg>
<seg id=380>
Also, in our view we support the social dialogue and cooperation with civil society and in particular with women' s associations of the countries that are preparing its annexation to the European family, since we must also achieve a uniform development to continue the steps and the logic of the rest of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=381>
The action areas listed in the communication from the Commission have also been the subject of an overall agreement.
</seg>
<seg id=382>
I remember, at this stage of my speech, a seminar to be held in Biarritz European, which I will chair, on this subject on 4 and 5 December.
</seg>
<seg id=383>
With regard to the fight against the exclusions, we have come a long way to define, on 17 October, in the Council on employment and social policy objectives appropriate to combat poverty and social exclusion, which will form the basis of national action plans.
</seg>
<seg id=384>
I have heard in some quarters that having read the report, agree with the diagnosis, but not with the formula.
</seg>
<seg id=385>
Technological development and new methods of organisation speak in favour of a flexible cooperation where we invest more for objectives and to achieve results and less rigid regulation.
</seg>
<seg id=386>
We need to find that, in our opinion, the archaic practice of which they are accused those who expect a market without obstacles is the best of all possible worlds.
</seg>
<seg id=387>
Of course, this has helped to reduce the discontent among workers in our country and to increase investment in the country from outside.
</seg>
<seg id=388>
On the other hand, the method used is more debatable.
</seg>
<seg id=389>
If we are talking about a Charter of fundamental rights and if we look at welcome a European constitution we cannot be estrábicos, but we have to say that it must take all the necessary steps, although this demand legislation more attentive and I do not think that Mrs
</seg>
<seg id=390>
I would like to point out critically the lack of initiatives on the new challenges in the workplace protection in the participation of workers and labour relations.
</seg>
<seg id=391>
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for this presentation of the social policy agenda.
</seg>
<seg id=392>
As we know, Conservatives are opposed to these points, our group attaches particular importance.
</seg>
<seg id=393>
The third issue is enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=394>
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 noon.
</seg>
<seg id=395>
The measures taken by the Commission must be complemented by studies on the individual access to health systems and social security and pension systems, on the shortcomings in the work organization and, perhaps, also on the general reduction of working hours.
</seg>
<seg id=396>
In this way, women feel Europe more closely, and Europe will gain with the interesting and innovative ideas expressed through its relationship with this programme.
</seg>
<seg id=397>
We hope an annual report of the President of the Commission within the framework of a debate to be held every year in the European Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=398>
I am also delighted that is envisaged a better distribution of childcare, in order to facilitate the balance between professional life and family life.
</seg>
<seg id=399>
My group will take account of that in his final vote.
</seg>
<seg id=400>
(The President cut the speaker off)
</seg>
<seg id=401>
I welcome the Commission' s new approach, and very well thought-out proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme.
</seg>
<seg id=402>
I believe that the large number of amendments adopted shows the common feeling of the European Commission and the Committee on Women' s rights and equal opportunities.
</seg>
<seg id=403>
On the one hand, over the past year I have received several requests for companies which have a certain impotence as a result of certain merger decisions, particularly relating to cases where they have had to go to the Commission' s decision before the Court of First Instance.
</seg>
<seg id=404>
I should also like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner Monti on when we can expect establishment of an effective and efficient public register of state aid, and also on when will become a reality at length promised table of results.
</seg>
<seg id=405>
I would also like to say to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next report are a rather more extensive paragraph dedicated to the financial services sector.
</seg>
<seg id=406>
What I have said it is not only to the field of energy policy, but also for all the other areas.
</seg>
<seg id=407>
Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work that has been carried out on both reports which give a positive opinion on your personal work and that of the Directorate-General for Competition.
</seg>
<seg id=408>
I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything and in this respect should not be and cannot be unrestricted competition.
</seg>
<seg id=409>
Mr President, today no one disputes and, of course, I am not going to do, that public aid alter the conditions of competition and are a harmful element which encourages the inefficiency of companies.
</seg>
<seg id=410>
To hear you deny the fact that public aid have fallen during the period 1994-1998, when the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction has been at least rather strange.
</seg>
<seg id=411>
And, of course, Mr President, although my opinion relates to the XXIX the Commission Report on Competition Policy, we cannot at the moment to look to the past, but nothing more than to learn for the future.
</seg>
<seg id=412>
Mr President, during the time available to me, I would like to address three points: the modernisation of Community law in the field of competition, the activities in 1999 in relation to the rules of competition and the issue of state aid.
</seg>
<seg id=413>
The Commission has followed acting firm and in particular against cartels and the abuse of a dominant position.
</seg>
<seg id=414>
Mr Rapkay, to the Commission has been very important to have the support of the European Parliament in the search for its competition policy and I do not believe that this support will disappear.
</seg>
<seg id=415>
This mechanism can be activated or at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a provision which is still in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States that are currently the subject of an exception, namely Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
</seg>
<seg id=416>
For the future, recourse to the capital market should remain the only option.
</seg>
<seg id=417>
I therefore ask that the report in its current version will be the conformity of the House and that this can also be used in the field of material propagation of the vine in the internal market.
</seg>
<seg id=418>
Today, its review is necessary in view of the development of the phytosanitary regulations and the scientific and technical progress has been made, particularly as far as the increase in vitro refers
</seg>
<seg id=419>
Also, this precautionary principle, I believe that refer to the possibility of genetic modifications means, for example, to reduce the intensive use of plant protection treatments, on the other hand, in the sense of precautionary the amendments by Mrs
</seg>
<seg id=420>
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, in order to comply with the precautionary principle, both in letter and in spirit, if unfortunately articles and amendments I have just mentioned were not removed, we need to stick to the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin and, therefore, the Committee on the Environment, and vote in favour of its abolition.
</seg>
<seg id=421>
Mr President, if you will allow me: Commissioner, could you give us its opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, public Health and consumer Policy? is Amendment No 1.
</seg>
<seg id=422>
The only point on which we could talk about is whether it should I have taken note or not in the French Government sent to me the languor resolution of the mandate of Mr Le Pen.
</seg>
<seg id=423>
I would remind the honourable Member that the vote will take place later, at 12.30 noon.
</seg>
<seg id=424>
In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution to the civil judicial cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id=425>
The preparatory group will play its full role until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.
</seg>
<seg id=426>
We needed this exciting climate, as Mr Moscovici has said and I was also, at the level of the Heads of State or Government, a very serious sense of collective responsibility and historic in a historic moment in European integration.
</seg>
<seg id=427>
There will simply be, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure from now on, with regard to these issues of qualified majority voting, that we are not here the spirit or the climate of Biarritz.
</seg>
<seg id=428>
The small countries are not on the orders of the largest Member States of the European Union!
</seg>
<seg id=429>
I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.
</seg>
<seg id=430>
On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event.
</seg>
<seg id=431>
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, although progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, there are still profound disagreements on the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out.
</seg>
<seg id=432>
It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction.
</seg>
<seg id=433>
Those who are outside of enhanced cooperation really enjoy the same freedom that passengers seats back a car.
</seg>
<seg id=434>
I am not here, nor the honourable Member, in order to ingerirme in the German Home affairs, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and is, moreover, the direction in which the Commission wishes to, if I am not mistaken.
</seg>
<seg id=435>
We have begun to exchange views in this respect, it is clear that all the Member States want the maintenance of the ceiling after enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=436>
I believe that this will not happen.
</seg>
<seg id=437>
Firstly, we have sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz had a obsession with the debate between small and large states.
</seg>
<seg id=438>
From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that we must safeguard the Community method.
</seg>
<seg id=439>
Also, when the candidate countries accede, each Member State must be able to maintain a Commissioner deputy or main.
</seg>
<seg id=440>
The wording of the text of Article 93 is all the more tragic that, once achieved the first wave of enlargement, we will find it even more difficult to move towards the qualified majority.
</seg>
<seg id=441>
We must convince the citizens of these countries of the clear merits of any new European Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=442>
Imagine that the fears fed for generations could give the final appeasement without new shocks, prelude to reconciliation, it would have been ignore the resources of such a crisis.
</seg>
<seg id=443>
I am also looks no correspondence in Parliament calls for the issue on democratisation.
</seg>
<seg id=444>
Those guilty of this are rather those who advocate that reforms are made prior to enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=445>
On the one hand, the decision of the head of the Israeli Government to freeze the peace negotiations by the violence in the region and to focus its efforts on the creation of a government of national unity with the leader of the opposition, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=446>
We have learned a great deal of satisfaction of the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election as President Kostunica.
</seg>
<seg id=447>
I would urge you most strongly to Mr Barón Crespo to ask his colleagues Italian them to explain to you why are in government in Italy with a party decidedly communist and why are preparing to take part in the elections with another party decidedly Communist Party Comunista.
</seg>
<seg id=448>
On the contrary, in these areas, would have make progress in the application of the codecision procedure!
</seg>
<seg id=449>
The Commission, which has the possibility to make their own decisions by a simple majority, is in a more favourable situation to give this momentum in the future.
</seg>
<seg id=450>
The Union does not need now visionaries who have the telescope because in the year 2030, but that needs leaders who are able to catch the problems that will bring the completion of enlargement in a period of 3 to 8 years, as well as for providing answers to them.
</seg>
<seg id=451>
Therefore, it is an open work which has not fallen from above and has not been imposed.
</seg>
<seg id=452>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=453>
In the absence of this fundamental reference, in the best we understand each other, and at worst, we slaughtered each other.
</seg>
<seg id=454>
Democracy has improved in Europe, but, for its part, the European democracy is ill.
</seg>
<seg id=455>
Today, 24 October 2000 in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says something simple, and I say this as very high: the European constitution? yes, you can achieve this, yes, we want to see.
</seg>
<seg id=456>
In other words, it expresses the idea that the insularity in itself is a criterion enough.
</seg>
<seg id=457>
I will go to the essential concentrándome in the salient points of the report by President Gil-Robles, of which I would simply like to say that I find excellent.
</seg>
<seg id=458>
Firstly, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.
</seg>
<seg id=459>
I am not going to go further, because we are not here - in any case, I am not here - to discuss the report by the European University Institute in Florence.
</seg>
<seg id=460>
According to the information - I am going to be technical, forgive me - which has been communicated to the Presidency, I believe that a clear majority of the language versions, contrary to the Italian version, only refers to the implementation of cohesion policy, to the least favoured islands, and not to the islands in general.
</seg>
<seg id=461>
Mr Duhamel, of course you will agree with me to say that if there is no success in Nice, there will be no place, at least there will be no credibility, for a reflection on the future of European integration, at least in the current framework.
</seg>
<seg id=462>
This European Constitution must also establish clearly the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union and incorporate the dynamics of European integration in those areas, such as foreign and security policy, in that there is a need for common action.
</seg>
<seg id=463>
Could also be necessary to overcome persistent blockages.
</seg>
<seg id=464>
We must clarify the distribution of competences and the principle of subsidiarity.
</seg>
<seg id=465>
As you know, in the various Member States and between the various social forces very different opinions on this.
</seg>
<seg id=466>
Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European constitution would be exactly the opposite, and it is clear that we cannot approve it.
</seg>
<seg id=467>
In fact, in the strengthened European home, there will be invited to the military table peoples, monetary union, possibly tax, and then the other peoples, which will be.
</seg>
<seg id=468>
It is clear that the second version is incorrect because, firstly, in one way or another the Structural Funds cover economically disadvantaged regions and, secondly, because if this interpretation was the right one, not discussed on the adoption of the nº30 statement.
</seg>
<seg id=469>
Mr President, I would like to focus my small sixty seconds in Olivier Duhamel' s report, which is a good report, because dares to say things clearly, and the fine words of our rapporteur has convinced us definitely a short while ago.
</seg>
<seg id=470>
In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be policy.
</seg>
<seg id=471>
It seems to us that the new Constitution should be about to enter into force for the next European elections.
</seg>
<seg id=472>
As a result, the described as "least developed" applies both to the island regions and the rest of the regions and, according to the proposal by Mr Barnier, that this is a change in the Italian version of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.
</seg>
<seg id=473>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=474>
As my colleague said that I was going to vote against, this amendment lapses.
</seg>
<seg id=475>
Mr President, what is called for here is a formula for chaos.
</seg>
<seg id=476>
I welcome the adoption by the European Parliament of the Trakatellis report, because has very strict standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives.
</seg>
<seg id=477>
If the immunity of Members of the European Parliament is autonomous, the French authorities should have required of the waiver of Mr Le Pen.
</seg>
<seg id=478>
I am particularly disappointed by the European Parliament' s vote on the report on the proliferation of vineyards.
</seg>
<seg id=479>
For some, alcohol is as tobacco and drugs, a product which damages public much to those who use and the people around them; other, on the other hand, are above all as a source of employment and something that we can gain a great deal of money.
</seg>
<seg id=480>
The rapporteur broadly welcomes the proposals of the Commission' s White Paper in this respect, but you are concerned about the possible consequences of the reform, designed mainly to decentralise the application of the rules of competition.
</seg>
<seg id=481>
- (FR) although, in the debate yesterday evening, I congratulated Jonathan Evans on his work, I had to express my deep disagreement with the entry excessively liberal approach, even ultraliberal, of his report.

The Agency for industrial development of Ireland has been by reorganizing its orientation to achieve half of the new jobs resulting from projects in new areas in the Objective 1 region in the next three years.

The situation in October 2000, in the run-up to take a decision on the figures of the 2001 budget, is as follows.
</seg>
<seg id=486>
However, the Council did not hesitate to reduce agricultural expenditure by EUR 555 million in total.
</seg>
<seg id=487>
Moreover, we also believe, of course, that should not be simply create 400 additional posts, in addition to the existing ones.
</seg>
<seg id=488>
I can only recommend the Council to follow our example.
</seg>
<seg id=489>
The administration of this House must therefore be at the service of the members and not the other way round.
</seg>
<seg id=490>
The Court of Auditors is less concerns causes us at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id=491>
Finally, it is also up to us to examine the Ombudsman' s budget.
</seg>
<seg id=492>
On the contrary, we believe that we should strengthen research, particularly with a view to the accession of the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=493>
We also propose that we continue to report regularly to Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=494>
And when we have a legislative conciliation on social affairs, culture or the environment - the Commissioner is going to acknowledge that I am right, we met the Budget Commissioner, the finance ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets to read together, so that we do not make a financial nonsense.
</seg>
<seg id=495>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your reception.
</seg>
<seg id=496>
Moreover, the room for manoeuvre, in particular with regard to the limits of category 3 and category 4, the Council would like to give the Parliament, last competent body in relation to these non-compulsory expenditure, the opportunity to express its priorities, without calling into question the Council, therefore, I am simply going to emphasise the salient points of the Council' s draft budget.
</seg>
<seg id=497>
These are two often recurrent issues in the discussions between Parliament and the Council and that could give pattern, if we are not careful, tensions between the two branches of the budgetary authority.
</seg>
<seg id=498>
The situation is similar when it comes to the structural policy.
</seg>
<seg id=499>
The outcome of the conciliation procedure this summer was also satisfactory, as has already been pointed out by Mr Colom i Naval, specifically in the sense that in the future will also the provision of information to Parliament in relation to the legal bases with repercussions on expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=500>
Let me remind you that in the Financial Perspective which was adopted last year only be envisaged 1,850 million for the Balkans for the period up to 2006.

<seg id=501>
I would ask you once again to examine this proposal - the Commission is on the table - without trial conceived and that the view also as an opportunity.
</seg>
<seg id=502>
This material was, of course, useful for the preparation of the budget for 2001 and for the granting of discharge for 1999.
</seg>
<seg id=503>
Despite the fact that, as a member of the same, I very much appreciate the work of this committee and despite the great respect to the work of the rapporteurs, in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I must insist on two amendments that our committee has tabled before the plenary and which are still important although the amounts have been reduced.
</seg>
<seg id=504>
We want to achieve with these measures that judicial control again function fully restore confidence in the legal security within the European Union and consolidate its character as a Community of law.
</seg>
<seg id=505>
The removal of this initiative on the part of the Commission, without replacing it with any other, was clearly contrary to the political will of the Lisbon Summit and the priorities of this House.
</seg>
<seg id=506>
It was a staggering decision and many of us had the feeling that this very important programme had become just a football match between the Committee on Budgets and the Committee.
</seg>
<seg id=507>
The third issue is the European agricultural policy as is now in the budget proposal.

If employment is the political priority of the Union, fishing as an economic sector cannot remain on the sidelines.

For example, our aid to the Mediterranean countries has a delay affecting the budgets of many years.

Mr President, in the debates in previous years I spoke on behalf of the Committee on culture, youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which Mrs Iivari has represented this evening.
</seg>
<seg id=512>
But I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends only 1% of GDP and the administration of a large part are a matter for individual Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=513>
Let me turn to the global strategy.
</seg>
<seg id=514>
This brings me to the strategy of our group, because the essence of our concept is the desire that the Funds have an adequate return for European citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=515>
On the contrary, we must work for a parliament to make campaign in favour of transparency, efficiency and the effective democratic control of the European institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=516>

</seg>
<seg id=529>
My answer is very simple.
</seg>
<seg id=530>
Ramiro Zapata was the last of the 25 human rights activists murdered, and recently the Colombian press has denounced the "100" plan of the paramilitary groups to kill human rights activists.
</seg>
<seg id=531>
Today I am a little more satisfied that in July with the attitude of the Council, because, as many times in crisis situations, the European Union always seems to be the last authority to reach the international stage and make its voice heard.
</seg>
<seg id=532>
The question, Mr President, and I will end here, is whether or not there is a form of pressure greater than that proposed by the President in its information and if the aid that we are going to give will be completely different from that of the United States, that is to say, addressed not to the fumigation of crops, but the replacement of crops and also to the social aspects and not to the military.

Subject: tax on financial transactions the demand for a taxation of speculative capital has been gaining ground in the last few months, with the proliferation of the ATTAC committees (Association pour unites taxation South them Transactions financières et pour l l'aide aux citoyens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments tabled in the French National Assembly and in the Senate of the same country.
</seg>
<seg id=536>
I would also like to respond to the question of its influence on the volatility of the currency markets and, in particular, the impact of a tax of 0.1 20 on the profiteers who expect devaluations of the order of 50% to%.

<seg id=549>
Joan Colom i Naval, Vice-President responsible buildings, has already introduced this strategy.
</seg>
<seg id=550>
The political messages in this year' s budget are - as Commissioner Schreyer has already said - many, the restructuring of the agricultural policy, the new structural programmes, to ensure better implementation of the structural policy, the follow-up to the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit relating to the creation of an EU stronger and more competitive and to the fight against social exclusion.
</seg>
<seg id=551>
NATO' s war has too many havoc and has caused too much misery.
</seg>

Despite what was agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective with the current budgetary constraints without undermining the necessary agricultural budget for sustainable rural sector in the current Member States.

<seg id=553>
And I say so clear and unequivocal: Kostunica must be given a chance and I hope that in the coming weeks and months put in place an amnesty, but in the meantime I do want to political and budgetary level to political conditions to the implementation of these two new budget lines, that is to say, democratisation and reconstruction.
</seg>
<seg id=554>
The Yugoslav elections have shown two things: finally people has been hastiado of the dictator Milosevic and at the same time hopes in the Kostunica professor.

Not to do so, lapse inevitably in the "financial engineering" , in the transfers and reductions either in general expenses either in the social and environmental expenditure either in cooperation, but the fact is that, in spite of this, the appropriations for the Balkans will remain inadequate.
</seg>
<seg id=557>
In this context, we need efforts to resolve the major social problems such as, for example, the unemployment.
</seg>
<seg id=558>
There is an issue which is, of course, of great importance: we have started looking at category four, but has not yet been entirely clear if we have been able to give you a solution, not least because the Council refuses in clear to provide ideas.
</seg>
<seg id=559>
The priorities are important in all budgetary work.

<seg id=560>
This is not very serious on the horizon next to the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if the legal framework postCECA maintained the possibility of extending such practices.
</seg>
<seg id=561>
And that brings me to my third point, the challenge ahead of us.
</seg>
<seg id=562>
The new financial agreement does not indicate anything about it, and I have been able to see that the European citizens distrust increasingly politicians.
</seg>
<seg id=563>

The dialogue availability of all the institutions involved has led to an exemplary cooperation that will enable us, I sincerely hope, to reach a consensus at first reading.

Those who represent European values in a country sceptical to the EU are now a new argument in favour of the Union, that is, better protection of personal integrity, something that is important for the citizens in modern society.
</seg>
<seg id=566>
In my own country will be reformed the law of personal data, depriving the parliamentary power on the decisions of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=567>
Many other points raised problems and deserve the trial of practice to be insured.
</seg>
<seg id=568>
The Commission would like to point out the compromise that we have all taken with the citizens to ensure the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=569>
With this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation be limited to the activities of the first pillar.
</seg>
<seg id=570>
With a view to honour the political agreement concluded with the Council and the rapporteur to allow the adoption at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that is not part of the Paciotti report adopted by the parliamentary Committee on Citizens' freedoms and rights, with the exception of Amendment No 69 which corrects Amendment No 41.
</seg>
<seg id=571>
It is a matter of urgency that the staff of the inter-service group be strengthened quickly at the heart of the Secretary-General of the Commission, so that all the proposed acts of general scope can be accompanied, during its examination by the College, in accordance with the terms of Article 299 (), for a detailed impact statement.
</seg>
<seg id=572>
From the point of view of the Committee on legal Affairs and the Internal market, I want to stress is that, in fact, can only be dealt with like what remains the same.
</seg>
<seg id=573>
Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only feel sorrow about this.
</seg>
<seg id=574>
Until now, since under the chairmanship of Delors created a inter-service group for the outermost regions, we have come a long and fruitful way and who has presided over this Group I must express the deep appreciation of the European outermost regions.
</seg>
<seg id=575>
In fact although before the Treaty of Rome, reference was made to the French overseas departments, it was not until 1989 and the programmes of specific actions linked to remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI, so that the European Union finally admit that the permanence and combination of the structural problems of the outermost regions forming the basis of a specific treatment with regard to the other regions of the Community.
</seg>
<seg id=576>
I have no doubt that the proposals for the Commission to make the Council will bear the stamp of these qualities.
</seg>
<seg id=577>
This question is becoming more and more important as we move towards the eastward enlargement of the EU.

I am concerned about the possibility of a general failure of many devices vote, which call into question the decisions adopted by the House.
</seg>
<seg id=586>
Both the Food Authority as legislative proposals that we propose, aimed at guaranteeing food safety, are going to have the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=587>
Its main task is to provide scientific advice, as the debate on food safety must also be credible.
</seg>
<seg id=588>
Mr President, in conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and their willingness to take into account the opinion of the other committees.
</seg>
<seg id=589>
When we are faced with a possible risk is important to apply the precautionary principle.
</seg>
<seg id=590>
On the controversial issue of how far we should go in regard to enable it to examine the nutrition, and even to submit recommendations and be consulted by those whose main task is the risk management, we have also said that in the field of security, the issues should at least be subject to public opinion and the advice of this Food Authority.
</seg>
<seg id=591>
A central idea is to ensure the survival of the rich heritage traditions.
</seg>
<seg id=592>
It is not the laws and regulations which form the basis for this respectability, but the integrity, the academic high quality, independence, the sense of responsibility, transparency and comprehensibility.
</seg>
<seg id=593>
Certainly, it is essential to be based on a good scientific knowledge, in order to assess the risks linked to the food chain, from farm to table.
</seg>
<seg id=594>
Mr President, it is clear that there is a considerable enthusiasm for the creation of a European food safety Agency, as our rapporteur prefers to denominarla.
</seg>
<seg id=595>
Given that the programme of the WHO continues with funds and the necessary support, it seems that there is absolutely no need for yet another agency, especially with such a limited scope such as the 15 Member States of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=596>
Food safety is the essential precondition for the consumer because consumers want to eat healthily and we have to address us.
</seg>
<seg id=597>
If we do not get a new framework directive many aspects relating to food safety will only be a dead letter.
</seg>
<seg id=598>
Consequently, we need to change the EU Treaty in such a way that gives the Commission power to apply sanctions in the food field, in the same way that is currently being done in the field of competition.
</seg>
<seg id=599>
I support all those who support the strategy "food for All" and working in the field political, administrative or any other.
</seg>
<seg id=600>
I do not share these words, because we know that man is not only body.
</seg>
<seg id=601>
This should represent the real heart of coordination of the network of national agencies which, in turn, must implement and coordinate a network of centres of excellence food safety at regional level.
</seg>
<seg id=602>
I therefore believe that Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 17 are perfectly compatible.
</seg>
<seg id=603>
The reform of the food laws of the European Union will be carried out at European Union level.
</seg>
<seg id=604>
The report does not contains many amendments but is limited to emphasise certain issues.
</seg>
<seg id=605>
It is quite clearly stated in the report and I am very pleased to do so.
</seg>
<seg id=606>
However, the creation of a European Food Safety Authority is very positive.
</seg>
<seg id=607>
It is to be hoped that all these criteria are met for the good of the citizens of the Union as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id=608>
I think that it is essential to indicate margins temporary certain that the European Commission must be informed in cases of justified concern.
</seg>
<seg id=609>
The EU must have the highest possible levels of food security for EU citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=610>
The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Authority.
</seg>
<seg id=611>
Fear that Europe will run the risk of afford a inflated apparatus officials who is unable to act.

</seg>
<seg id=613>

<seg id=614>
However, we must avoid a situation where, under the debate on the White Paper, increase in public opinion the fear of a bureaucratic Europe, which has an impact on the quality of products, without penalizing fraud effectively that threaten the health of consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=615>
As you know, the Commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety.
</seg>
<seg id=616>
The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the principles and objectives global food legislation, which will provide the framework for the future health protection measures in the area of foodstuffs.
</seg>
<seg id=617>
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=618>
Turning now to our report, I welcome the Commission' s proposal and I have to say that the Parliamentary committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development have worked hard to improve it further, particularly in some points.
</seg>
<seg id=619>
As you said very explicit and clear Mrs Bonino, with the Commission' s proposal for a regulation has been given a new step forward.
</seg>
<seg id=620>
The Commission' s proposal for a regulation seems to us to be too vague.
</seg>

It is necessary for the allocation for the elimination of mines is organised in a reasonable way and to promote research to carry out work of detection and disposal, to instruments that can be used in a simple way on the ground to provide aid in the developing countries.
</seg>
<seg id=622>
Over the last eight years, we have contributed more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget, the fight against landmines.
</seg>
<seg id=623>
But we cannot penalise the people who have a bad government.
</seg>
<seg id=624>
Firstly, as I have already mentioned, I believe that it would be a mistake, well-intentioned, but counterproductive, impose the accession to the Ottawa Convention as a prerequisite for Community assistance to mine action.

Mr President, I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said before, I am not going to repeat it. I waive my speaking time.
</seg>
<seg id=640>
The concept that you have the open cooperation is fall into the institutional framework dominated by the officials of the Commission.

<seg id=661>
In fact, the special features of these regions, in general due to the insularity and remoteness from the continent of Europe, but also to the chronic dependence on a single production or a few, require specific measures appropriate to overcome those limitations.

It is very clear that the aim of the agency is to channel the powers of national defence, or paralizarlos to them at the service of the objectives of the Commission.

<seg id=664>
That does not mean that the Commission and Parliament denominen this agency "European authority" name which runs totally counter to the philosophy is based.
</seg>
<seg id=665>
That is not what we proposed by the Bowis report, which gives the impression that the food safety is considered primarily as a new pretext to feed the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of the national bodies and bodies to protect the safety of our citizens.

</seg>
<seg id=691>
For years we have been calling for a harmonisation of efforts, because, at the end of the day, it is possible to establish a rapid system, safe and cheap.
</seg>
<seg id=692>
In my opinion, this report is of the utmost importance to integrate effectively to our citizens, small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and increase the acceptance of economic and monetary union.
</seg>
<seg id=693>
There must be no obstacles or major differences when there is a free movement of capital with a single currency.
</seg>
<seg id=694>
However, the European Parliament and the Commission attach great importance.
</seg>
<seg id=695>
I support the policy to two gangs with which the rapporteur wants to encourage the lazy banks to act.
</seg>
<seg id=696>
Radwan and Mrs Peijs on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, which requires measures to be adopted before the end of next year and, preferably, the establishment of these standards before they come into circulation of euro notes and coins.
</seg>
<seg id=697>
The proposal we are presenting Mrs Peijs and I is a step in the direction that lay banks in a Bureau not to make concessions, because we cannot increase the political pressure.
</seg>
<seg id=698>
After all, if the system for the implementation of cross-border payments remains as expensive as it is today, the credibility of the new system of coins and notes will be in question.
</seg>
<seg id=699>
We believe that this form of collection of statistical data on the system of payments within the Union is a relic of the past; in a single integrated area and leave to be justified, and which constitute an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market.
</seg>
<seg id=700>
To hear the speeches of some of my fellow Members in the committees, some of which have been here longer than I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament is for the fourth time, falls into this category.
</seg>
<seg id=701>
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the support that will bring about in advance to my report.
</seg>
<seg id=702>
If we reject this political action at European level, must then offer more opportunities for the regions.
</seg>
<seg id=703>
SMEs are the main source of job creation, both in terms of its quality and its quantity. play an essential role in social cohesion and to town and country planning.
</seg>
<seg id=704>
The care with proposals made by the study and the concertation which has pursued with many interested parties have been a triumph for better define and optimise the establishment of this programme.
</seg>
<seg id=705>
Thirdly, we have to find the European added value.
</seg>
<seg id=706>
It follows that small and medium-sized enterprises can only go well if the unemployment rate is reduced and public administrations at all levels are not debt and have sufficient resources to send to the budgets of investment.
</seg>
<seg id=707>
Businesses need clarity.
</seg>
<seg id=708>
In particular, if an employer individual or a company with 250 employees with a project, it cannot be the only way to receive funding collateral security of 120%, but must also be possible to receive funding for which has only a good idea.
</seg>
<seg id=709>
The Member States, and even the regional or local authorities already behave like real financial bombs, which drenan taxpayers' money, that is to say sums held to the majority of the population, including the poorest, and the redirected to big business and therefore to their owners and shareholders.
</seg>
<seg id=710>
The breeding ground for small and medium-sized enterprises includes thousands of fragile attempts that feed human potential and ideas to big business.
</seg>
<seg id=711>
Of the measures we have proposed here, which I would like to address the Commissioner is to facilitate and speed up access to aid and information for the people who addressed these companies can use them effectively.
</seg>
<seg id=712>
All of them will hold a special place in the multiannual programme.
</seg>
<seg id=713>
Finally, I welcome the idea of work an annual meeting to carry out an assessment of the introduction of the programme.
</seg>
<seg id=714>
The recent incidents to the detriment of the Greek minority in Himarë are the urgent need to promote democratisation measures, strengthening of the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.
</seg>
<seg id=715>
A considerable number of Albanians leave their land by the uncertainty that prevails in their own country, for the social difficulties, for their social structures and premodernas family.
</seg>
<seg id=716>
We need preventive measures specially designed for Albania which contribute to the construction or reconstruction of the country, in order to make possible a dignified life in the region.
</seg>
<seg id=717>
That is how van from one jurisdiction to the other documents and the European Commission, for example, refuses to publish the report on, among other things, the customs Assistance Mission (CAM), drawn up by the Albanians.
</seg>
<seg id=718>
We see as they really are.
</seg>
<seg id=719>
Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on broad and extensive evidence for his report.
</seg>
<seg id=720>
This is a matter of the utmost importance, created under the influence of factors historical, social, political and economic.
</seg>
<seg id=721>
We will never know the real number of deaths.
</seg>
<seg id=722>
The common commercial activities engage people in a peaceful manner.
</seg>
<seg id=723>
On the contrary, I think it is unacceptable in this report, and I say this quite clearly, that the effect is confused with the cause, that is to say that the procedure is confused balanced issue of visas and, therefore, the possibility of emigrate, to the cause of illegal immigration.
</seg>
<seg id=724>
The major institutional reforms arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam have influenced the management of asylum and immigration issues.
</seg>
<seg id=725>
Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its implementation ways must be evaluated on a regional basis.
</seg>
<seg id=726>
But, of course, this request we also requires us not throw the baby out with the bathwater in the volume of Community rules.
</seg>
<seg id=727>
Precisely now must be emphasised strength of Community action.
</seg>
<seg id=728>
I also that the changes to the proposals on codification of European legislation in force are carried out by the inclusion of amendments in the directive or regulations in force.
</seg>
<seg id=729>
Understood with property, the principle of subsidiarity is in two directions: the decision-making at the lowest possible level, and the recognition of the fact that the lowest possible level can be a very high level, when there is general goods at stake that will be lost unless that are protected in the same terms everywhere.
</seg>
<seg id=730>
The report is a clear and concise draft model and I hope that colleagues will take with the seriousness it deserves.
</seg>
<seg id=731>
The report of the Committee on legal Affairs and the Internal market did not receive the enthusiasm of its members.
</seg>
<seg id=732>
That is what I meant in the report on the SLIM project, because Community legislation, and Mr Medina has just to prove with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, find it hard to understand, even for the experts.
</seg>
<seg id=733>
Therefore, I some aspects of the report I produced little enthusiasm, because I would have liked to have seen a report comunitarizante with regard to the internal market and, above all, on this point, of course, are not wind blowing in the report.
</seg>
<seg id=734>
The important thing for the EU institutions is that we have a strong commitment to raise the quality of legislation, especially with regard to subsidiarity.
</seg>
<seg id=735>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=736>
The maintenance of this situation could have a negative impact on the acceptance and in the opinion of the citizens about the euro.
</seg>
<seg id=737>
Mr President, in the Committee on Citizens' freedoms and rights, Justice and home affairs carefully prepare the Karamanou report.
</seg>
<seg id=738>
However, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take our oral question and this debate to express on both sides - because both is our motion for a resolution, and I would like to do so with great composure, a number of comments.
</seg>
<seg id=739>
The peoples of the Union that we represent here so demand.
</seg>
<seg id=740>
But, has already been a great deal of water under the bridge, the agreement has passed and has not been replaced.
</seg>
<seg id=741>
I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but I cannot understand the Director-General.
</seg>
<seg id=742>
We could say that, months after the mooring, we are still paying the previous agreement and the previous of the previous one.
</seg>
<seg id=743>
Mr President, a year ago we had a similar debate and the fact that he had to spend a year to ensure that the opening of negotiations highlights the difficulty of finding fishing grounds for the enormous fleets of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=744>
In the second agreement, things were very clear.
</seg>
<seg id=745>
But we must also understand that nothing is ever, not even fishery resources!
</seg>
<seg id=746>
That is why I am particularly keen to make it clear that if something has highlighted the PPE-DE Group is not only to support, defend and lead to the fisheries agreements, but rather to promote its extension resolutely.
</seg>
<seg id=747>
Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement is interrupted, has continued the exploitation of the Sahara fishing ground for Community and non-Community fleets that are not subject to the control of the Commission nor the Member States: it talks about above all an important fleet in the Netherlands.
</seg>
<seg id=748>
I understand that, because these fisheries represented a source of income and work for a poor region in relation to the rest of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=749>
Another aspect that I would like to highlight is that at the end of the month concludes the temporary aid paid to the fishermen and shipowners to compensate for this year staging posts, which is an untenable situation, given that all prefer the aid work.
</seg>
<seg id=750>
This parliamentary supporter of Andalusian autonomy has been in existence for a year now negotiating and proposing initiatives in the corridors, by the offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and the hearings with the Commissioner to take account of the especialísima character of the Andalusian fishing fleet which fishes in Morocco.
</seg>
<seg id=751>
Spain has developed in a more difficult outstanding way neighbourhood relationship has been repeatedly raised in history between Europe and North Africa, between Spain and Morocco.
</seg>
<seg id=752>
As a Member of Parliament Spanish and Andalusian, I support the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend, and to defend their jobs in this Parliament, who are at risk from almost a year ago.
</seg>
<seg id=753>
We shall now move to the vote.
</seg>
<seg id=754>
A history of twelve years almost full of consuelos since the offices, delaying tactics, hopes, staff need also placebos for those affected, old persistent defence rights in relation to the citizens looking for something else that their rights.
</seg>
<seg id=755>
As you know, the issue is a very complex and affects some people who work in more than Italian universities.
</seg>
<seg id=756>
If we reform and change the Italian legal system, as has happened to the university staff, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene from the moment that all European citizens enjoy equal access to all the professional categories.
</seg>
<seg id=757>
The injustice lies in which two people doing the same work, working together, they do so, however, with different salaries and under different conditions.
</seg>
<seg id=758>
Worst of all, in my view, is to have to inform you that a favourable judgment can does not constitute more than some reassuring words and will not be a real change in their lives.
</seg>
<seg id=759>
I would remind the Commission that I hope to respond to what the judgment of the Court, in the case Allué, expressed as follows: "by this dictates that is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty, the law of a Member State restricted in any case the duration of the contracts of foreign language assistants to one year, with the possibility of renewal, if in principle this limit does not apply to other teachers" .
</seg>
<seg id=760>
Well, I believe that these matters lead to the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, in particular freedom of movement, and we cannot make exceptions to these principles.
</seg>
<seg id=761>
We still have jobs, as today has been in this discussion, too many obstacles, too many obstacles to this internal market, and not just in this case.
</seg>
<seg id=762>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=763>
(The President cut the speaker off)
</seg>
<seg id=764>
And I propose a minute of respect.
</seg>
<seg id=765>
Are there any comments?
</seg>
<seg id=766>
I support the proposal put forward by Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful if the Council could clarify if has real intentions to present a new proposal on this matter.
</seg>
<seg id=767>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers such an important event that we do not believe would receive an appropriate treatment in the form of a matter of urgency.
</seg>
<seg id=768>
Galeote have just set out, and I have the impression that you adheres to these reasons, Mr Barón Crespo, if I understood him correctly.
</seg>
<seg id=769>
Madam President, some time ago we discussed in this Parliament the issue of the sanctions on Iraq.
</seg>
<seg id=770>
It is a matter of urgency that we hold a debate before the introduction of the amendment proposed by the British authorities, and that the Commission will send a clear signal what the rules must be observed in this respect.
</seg>
<seg id=771>
(A5-0314/2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' freedoms and rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, especially in the area of the fight against organised crime, laundering of the proceeds of infringements and the financial crime C5-0394/2000.
</seg>
<seg id=772>
The statements must be followed by practical measures taken to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
</seg>
<seg id=773>
The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialised agency, subject to only control of the national governments.
</seg>
<seg id=774>
On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft convention just to essential interests the grounds for refusing assistance which could invoke the requested state.
</seg>
<seg id=775>
To begin with, I would like to congratulate Mr Marinho on the work he has done and I would like to say that, in fact, attempts to combat organised crime must be given support and attention.
</seg>
<seg id=776>
Trace, pursue, condemn the laundering of dirty money of the terrorists and their arms and drugs traffickers, of course it does!
</seg>
<seg id=777>
Our task is to proceed to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organized crime.
</seg>
<seg id=778>
All these considerations are contained in the amendments and, judging by the debate in the committee, I very much hope that Parliament will adopt these amendments.
</seg>
<seg id=779>
In my opinion, the establishment of these initiatives is progressing in a way which can ignore the protection provided for in Article 6 of the European Convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms.
</seg>
<seg id=780>
However, in reality, all this is not so easy.
</seg>
<seg id=781>
Finally, Mr President, the group of the European People' s Party supports the compromise amendment that we have reached with Mrs Roure on the activities of lawyers.
</seg>
<seg id=782>
The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation.
</seg>
<seg id=783>
This is a Portuguese initiative which already have praised by previous speakers.
</seg>
<seg id=784>
And that was the subject of the joint meeting of the justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council of 17 October.
</seg>
<seg id=785>
The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control of Europol is the full integration of the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=786>
A step in the right direction that the European Parliament is trying to give for a long time is the creation of a provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit.
</seg>
<seg id=787>
This is the sense of guarantees, that is to say, to make progress this aspect of the freedoms.
</seg>
<seg id=788>
The European Parliament is the Community supranational body able to establish this relationship, and this speech I propose therefore to support this right support our rapporteur
</seg>
<seg id=789>
Only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice clarified, it will be possible for the citizens and Parliament give its opinion on each of the measures proposed by the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=790>
For this reason, Europol is a logical step in the process to provide the citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice, by strengthening the fight against organised crime.
</seg>
<seg id=791>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gebhardt is to be congratulated on the excellent report he has presented, in line with the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.
</seg>
<seg id=792>
But given that Eurojust, there is the coordination of the tax and national courts in the fight against all forms of serious crime - and in this I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - the broad concept: it is not only cooperation for the purely transnational crime, also refers to cooperation in the fight against the criminal activities.
</seg>
<seg id=793>
We will have the opportunity, as from 1 January 2001, enter into this provisional unit, but the Commission wants to hold a debate on what should be the final unity of Eurojust.
</seg>
<seg id=794>
Each part had warmly for your position, I believe, without lapsing into rigid confrontations.
</seg>
<seg id=795>
The problems encountered in expenditure had not excessively to the Committee on Fisheries, although gave more attention to other matters.
</seg>
<seg id=796>
It is totally unacceptable that we do not have clear objectives and we can measure the results, which would not happen in any other institution.
</seg>
<seg id=797>
Second point: in the area of the hierarchy in the planning power of payments has been come here to intersections unacceptable, Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=798>
I would like with that stress that played a positive role for a number of problems.
</seg>
<seg id=799>
It is obvious that this work in a consortium does not create any duality in the joint financial responsibility.
</seg>
<seg id=800>
We have therefore really acted to recover EUR 3.4 million, and it is fair to say that we have achieved in more than 90%.
</seg>
<seg id=801>
Are there any comments?
</seg>
<seg id=802>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months of work and long wrangling in search of a consensus, we now have on the table a draft Charter of fundamental rights.
</seg>
<seg id=803>
I hope that, even if today is limited to vote in favour of this Charter, this House will make it indubitablemente clear in the next few weeks calling on the Council to the obligation of the Charter and that it also includes the possibility recourse to the European Court of Justice.
</seg>
<seg id=804>
This position is unites, as you know, adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz in which they themselves adopted unanimously and without reservations, the Charter and, therefore, I can only invite you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, but by some arguments.
</seg>
<seg id=805>
But above all it is because of the strength of its content and the Charter, I am sure, will time.
</seg>
<seg id=806>
For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has been able to condemn what she considers gaps, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage, for example.
</seg>
<seg id=807>
However, various personalities, and in particular the Members of the European Parliament, have proposed to include an explicit reference to the Charter of fundamental rights in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which refers to the Convention on Human Rights.
</seg>
<seg id=808>
Our Group unanimously supports the Charter with the single exception of the British delegation.
</seg>
<seg id=809>
The European people' s Party calls in its entirety and unanimously that the Charter of Fundamental rights to be incorporated into the Treaties as soon as possible, so that has the force of law direct to the people of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=810>
They have shown that it is possible to deal with the European affairs of a new and exemplary way, much better than the Intergovernmental Conference, given its democratic and open work, with the greatest transparency and which enables the participation of the citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=811>
The right to health, social security, housing, minimum wage are non-existent or only the order of solidarity.
</seg>
<seg id=812>
Fourthly, the Charter - and this seems to me to be particularly important - based on the principle of the indivisibility of human rights of citizenship and of a political nature and the fundamental rights of social order.
</seg>
<seg id=813>
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union and of our Member States to increase the ending instead with lame texts, the declarations of intent.
</seg>
<seg id=814>
The Commission' s representative in the Turin Convention attaches legal significance to the document.
</seg>
<seg id=815>
After the time of the market, when the Europe of rights perhaps has finally come, the concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.
</seg>
<seg id=816>
The Charter is drafted, in fact, as a binding text that can have a value.
</seg>
<seg id=817>
At the same time I would like to point out with great pride that a representative of my group in my own country, Gunnar Jansson, had an important role in the formulation of this Charter.
</seg>
<seg id=818>
As I said last night - and I will say today - throughout this Union there are many shortcomings in this respect and sometimes with our impatience to develop judicial and police cooperation, we overlook the importance of ensuring that the innocent are not passive victims, collateral damage of a war against crime.
</seg>
<seg id=819>
Madam President, the European Parliament' s draft resolution on the Charter of fundamental rights is based on the same ambiguity that the work of the House.
</seg>
<seg id=820>
The Italian Constitution provides for, for example, the limit of good conduct; the Convention provides for the limit of the rights of others, of public order.
</seg>
<seg id=821>
Mr President, in today' s vote on the 12 we will complete a process that began in 1984 when this Parliament approved the draft Treaty of the European Union, where appear already the request for a bill of rights, a process that we continue in 1989 with the De Gucht resolution.
</seg>
<seg id=822>
The Charter will have effects. will be whether or not in the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=823>
We must welcome and not with fear, as seems to think Mr Bondi.
</seg>
<seg id=824>
It seems that the century which is coming to an end, with all their struggles for the emancipation of the disadvantaged social classes, has happened in vain and has not taught us nothing.
</seg>
<seg id=825>
The Charter full a vacuum in Community law and strengthens the protection of individuals with regard to the atrocities of the European Police, the authorities combating fraud and the authorities that are responsible for competition.
</seg>
<seg id=826>
I do not understand the dissent who motivates because the Charter does not cover everything that would like to see included.
</seg>
<seg id=827>
Mr President, I will continue where it was Mr Gahrton.
</seg>
<seg id=828>
The third point I should like to make relates to the rights of citizens of third countries.
</seg>
<seg id=829>
The Council of Europe, as well as with the Court of Human Rights, with a great deal of experience in these forms of control, which we can take.
</seg>
<seg id=830>
In view of the text of the Charter that we shall be approving today - I hope that by a large majority -, it is clear that our Charter we are going to achieve a more comprehensive and more up-to-date protection of the fundamental rights which have been accession to the European Convention for the protection of human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=831>
That is why we need to go further.
</seg>
<seg id=832>
It seems to me important to bear this in mind if we want to achieve the necessary support of the citizens of Europe to the Charter.
</seg>
<seg id=833>
After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental rights will be my analysis guide for this report and as far as my personal means and intellectuals and the means with regard to colleagues that I provide you will allow me, I should like to make an analysis right by law, country by country of respect for the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=834>
- (FR) Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like, first of all, join the intentions of the Moscovici President, and to highlight the most important contribution that the Members of the European Parliament have contributed to the debate, to the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Méndez de Vigo has played in the Convention Praesidium for the drafting of the Charter of fundamental rights.
</seg>
<seg id=835>
I shall refer to some of the most salient points of this debate: firstly, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=836>
The Convention has chosen to include fundamental rights inspired by the various instruments of the Council of Europe, in the treaties, in the constitutions of the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=837>
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
</seg>
<seg id=838>
In the current state of affairs, it is up to Parliament to say the Turkish people that, at the moment, there are three conditions for membership.
</seg>
<seg id=839>
As a result, the European Investment Bank is one of the last ports of refuge banking activities in the world, not tarnish the waves of the social debate.
</seg>
<seg id=840>
That is why I have taken good note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon in relation to the conditions prior to the accession of Turkey and deserve the greatest interest.
</seg>
<seg id=841>
I am pleased to announce that the Turkish Government has accepted between this partnership as a basis for our future cooperation, so that we can good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out, i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey, give new impetus to the process of reform and move it with a view to the desired accession to the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=842>
The most important thing for me is that from Helsinki has begun in Turkey, between the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for Turkey' s accession to the EU, a debate which gives support to the forces of the country and contributes to its development.
</seg>
<seg id=843>
This text is waiting for its opinion.
</seg>
<seg id=844>
What we are now attempting to give a necessary boost in the scene of a future accession.
</seg>
<seg id=845>
However, I would urge Turkey - I do not know what will be the outcome of the vote - to take this issue seriously.
</seg>
<seg id=846>
The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with the political parties, NGOs and the press, in addition to develop their sensitive and sometimes tirante relationship with the grand National Assembly.
</seg>
<seg id=847>
Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, absolutely realistic and responsible.
</seg>
<seg id=848>
During his visit to Turkey in March at least mentioned by name the problem of the Kurdish people, as he has done today.
</seg>
<seg id=849>
Consider that Europeans will lead to the Turks, and I quote, "a radical change in their habits and mentality" at the same time it reveals a naïve and a great adequacy.
</seg>
<seg id=850>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today fills me with concern.
</seg>
<seg id=851>
Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233 (AVC))
</seg>
<seg id=852>
It has to be said, however, that the forthcoming occasions we are going to discuss the computer power, we will have to realise that we need a broader control and, therefore, more garantizador of the individual.
</seg>
<seg id=853>
Duff/Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325/2000)
</seg>
<seg id=854>
We would point out proposed an indicative:
</seg>
<seg id=855>
The rights laid down in the Charter are already part of the national constitutions and are defended by the national parliaments, close to the people and their cultures.
</seg>
<seg id=856>
For example, Article 19-1, which mentions that: "prohibit collective expulsions" , does not specify that the ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious disruption of public order.
</seg>
<seg id=857>
We are going to give a brief explanation of these three objections in order.
</seg>

The right of a government to stop arbitrarily its constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.

<seg id=859>
But, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions under which we have completed this important stage for Europe.

A society that only knows rights, and does not duties becomes a selfish society.

Despite the fact that the method of the Convention is interesting and fruitful to establish a basic text, looking for a broad compromise, there is no justification for are deprived of the European Parliament, that embodies the representation of the people of Europe, the possibility of amending, enrich the text.
</seg>
<seg id=863>
This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must propose a strategy which will enable us to bring it up to date and its enrichment.
</seg>
<seg id=864>
Therefore, the Charter should not be to decide and proclaim at the Nice Council, but that this summit to promote a European debate on it.
</seg>
<seg id=865>
Fortunately, the predominant trend of the national governments seems to indicate the path of common sense, that is to say, the acceptance of the Charter with a purely political scope and non-binding.

Created as "assembly" for the Cologne summit, autoproclamó "Convention" , a name which recalls unfortunately to 1793 and the terrorist implications of the French Revolution implemented by another convention.

In return, the method used, the exclusions proclaimed and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of this text cast a rather harsh light on the new efervescencias totalitarian operating in the very heart of the process of European integration.
</seg>
<seg id=868>
Fortunately, the European Parliament has not yet in this field more than an advisory role, pending a total implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but is the way to do so in the wrong direction, slowing down the right decisions.

<seg id=869>
On the other hand, there are discrepancies in the procedure.

Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey joint Parliamentary Committee, I offer intense attention to the draft accession of Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id=875>
The role of Turkey in Cyprus is not acceptable.
</seg>
<seg id=876>
However, we support the rapporteur' s criticism that an evaluation is needed on the granting of loans from the EIB and to the fact that there are shortcomings in matters of transparency and democratic control in the Bank' s activities.
</seg>
<seg id=877>
Turkey, with all its differentiation, has always been and continues to be an integral part of the European reality.
</seg>
<seg id=878>
Turkey' s accession to the European Union is now more than ever on an issue on the agenda.
</seg>
<seg id=879>
Mr Morillon says that Turkey must take care not to see the European Union as a "exclusive Christian club" that it wishes to exclude it.
</seg>
<seg id=880>
Turkey will be a fully democratic country when learn to live with its past, like the democratic Germany learned to live with yours and we would also ask it.
</seg>
<seg id=881>
The authorities in Ankara have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, it will be possible to make significant progress: the island can be reunited and tomorrow will provide a just, lasting and global regulation in accordance with international law.
</seg>
<seg id=882>
Really, why not included in the report of the European Commission?
</seg>
<seg id=883>
This is the balanced framework in which we will have to continue resolutely with our action in order to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id=884>
If we look at the Armenian issue in the context of the accession to the EU - and I would ask you to listen carefully to what I say: if we look at the Armenian issue in the context of the accession to the EU - the draft which we are debating today will not start; it is as simple as that.
</seg>
<seg id=885>
Moreover, it is also the reason for our insistence that make an assessment of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, in fact, we are in a position to establish the necessary guidelines.
</seg>
<seg id=886>
However, we have managed to keep the dialogue, and sometimes on sensitive issues: stability, terrorism, migration, human rights, for example.
</seg>
<seg id=887>
In addition, the Council has made an effort, in particular since 1995, provide the most important means Mediterranean, to the extent of the challenges of the partnership.
</seg>
<seg id=888>
This is, in fact, an extremely important issue and I would like to speak in my capacity as the central European.

<seg id=889>
Mr President, as you know, in English it says that when the star does not appear in a role as a representation of Hamlet without first death knell.

We want to see a pooling of policies on issues relating to the single market and Agreement to introduce the accumulation of origin together with regional free trade agreements so that all the partners keep free trade relations between itself and adopt the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.

<seg id=891>
We have learned with satisfaction that the Commission is prepared to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona process.
</seg>
<seg id=892>
I have highlighted these aspects because they must be sought the key to relaunch the process, and to this we must add the enlargement of the political agenda of Barcelona.
</seg>
<seg id=893>
Therefore, it must be our priority to ensure peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every effort for the sake of this cooperation and for the funds committed apply effectively, depending on the - so to speak, selfish generosity of the European Union.

These are important and specific issues that I would like to raise, and I would like to thank Mr Brok has authorised this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission would be able to discuss these issues.

The world is moving towards a unstoppable globalisation and in this context it is necessary to be organised in large blocks that will act as protagonists in the great stage of global competition.

It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have called for only just a quarter of the EUR 4,700 m for the MEDA I programme, which expired in 1999.
</seg>
<seg id=897>
For this is a good proposal for a new impetus which the Commission has made, and we agree fully with the two priorities that Mr Patten has marked in their speeches and reiterated here this evening.
</seg>
<seg id=898>
Is a wake-up call for the European Union to play a more active role in the Mediterranean area that historic and culturally enriched and engrandeció our European continent.

It is complicated procedures, but must never want to turn a blind eye, and I hope that the Member States do not do so, to the role they have played in this.

The media in that region have often been responsible for the tragedy that has experienced and totally free resources are necessary and to act in accordance with the rules that exist in our democracies.

<seg id=904>
Also, I am fortunate because I believe that Parliament has succeeded in getting to return to a situation that was not so good because has had a continuous pressure.
</seg>
<seg id=905>
I repeat once again: it is absolutely essential avoid unnecessary costs in unnecessary meetings.
</seg>
<seg id=906>
However, we must not look only in Kosovo.

<seg id=907>
It is also unfortunate that a number of programmes have been in the so-called reserve of action, "opførselsreserven" .

What initiatives will the Council take, as requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, to play a more active role in order to ensure the complete and utter implementation of the UN peace plan?
</seg>
<seg id=913>
How can take this new impetus without the resolution of this conflict, you know the close links between the European Union and Morocco, particularly between France and Morocco.
</seg>
<seg id=914>
I can only point out to you that France and Germany - here I am not speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - mentioned these matters in the course of a bilateral Summit in Vittel, last week, and decided to provide a working group in order to remedy the problem.
</seg>
<seg id=915>
At the same time, the Union is making an important material aid to these two countries, for the intermediary of its various programmes, especially TACIS.
</seg>
<seg id=916>
The honourable Member' s question gives, therefore, to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel certain confusion.
</seg>
<seg id=917>
And I would like to add a further precision: it is particularly in these two texts, to strengthen the criminal framework for combating the organised networks of smugglers.
</seg>
<seg id=918>
In the report that the Council of Ministers Turkish adopted on 21 September as reform programme, on the part of the legislative amendments several projects: included on the Civil Code measures to strengthen the effective equality of men and women in the areas socioeducativos; better fight against violence family; better condemn these violence through the creation of specialist judges in the field of family and, finally, to ban the possibility of a reduced penalties for crime of honour.

Therefore, the Presidency does not have to give an answer on this point.

Do you think that the model that has been followed in the case of Austria, that is, the bilateral decisions majority, could be used in the future as an instrument for decisions outside of the European institutions and to create a new institution or a new group, in order to be able to avoid the rule of unanimity in the Council?

President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici - which says that in order to make progress in Turkey' s association with the European Union, it is not possible to take into account the question of Cyprus?

We must bear in mind that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than just a fisheries agreement and, as he knows, if this agreement is not reached, bearing in mind what this means, this could hide a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.

<seg id=925>
That is why I have to say that I am sceptical on the result.
</seg>
<seg id=926>
With regard to the application of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should allow the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of the rights of the people.

<seg id=927>
The supplementary questions have to be other Members.

On the other hand, the Commission, in its communication that D adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union' s oil supply, points out that intends to present at the European Council in Gothenburg, a plan for energy saving and diversification of energy sources should help to strengthen the energy efficiency, especially in the buildings and transport.

In this spirit, we, on the occasion of the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 9 November, call on the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies defend human rights.

It is therefore up to NATO measures it considers necessary so that they do not occur again.

When one offers money is unquestionably the privilege to establish clearly the political objectives, and that is what has been done by the Commissioner.

If we see the region as a region of virtual political powers abuse we shall be committing a mistake.

The leaders agreed a framework 2000 extended and updated cooperation between Asia and Europe which is the work programme for the next decade.
</seg>
<seg id=941>
In my opinion, these issues remind us of the important role that Europe represents in Asia, not only in economic and commercial terms, although it should be noted that one of the reasons for the recovery of Asia is that we have kept our word to maintain open our markets to the Asian exports over the last two years.
</seg>
<seg id=942>
I believe that we have made an excellent political declaration, but some problems remain to be solved.
</seg>
<seg id=943>
We know that the Commission takes extremely seriously ASEM and we fully support this institution as far as that is concerned.

<seg id=944>
There is a need to improve the existing mechanisms in the transposition of Community law, to increase legal certainty and overcome their current slow.

<seg id=945>
That is why should promote the creation of new regional organisations, starting where there is already Community presence, as in the case of the Western Pacific and the South Pacific.
</seg>
<seg id=946>
This will make a real contribution to the fisheries are sustainable.
</seg>
<seg id=947>
I believe that the future of the fishing in international waters depends on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, there are few. to defend the position of the United Nations, both in the 1982 Convention and in New York, to which reference has been made here, we must have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing.
</seg>
<seg id=948>
That is why I believe that the Commission has a very important role to encourage fishermen to be at the forefront, cooperate with it and to propose a solution with which we are all agreed.
</seg>
<seg id=949>
In addition, the Commission must take responsibility for dealing with all kinds of tasks in connection with the negotiations that have taken place in the context of the regional fisheries organisations.
</seg>
<seg id=950>
Mr President, I have the same problem that Nicholson, but it is even more serious in my case.

Sometimes we have to ask ourselves to what extent the cyclical crisis of the market is not caused by the speculative action of these business structures, which will be ensuring the control of the sector on the basis of their interests.

The extra aid Community raised in Mr Garot' s report is, in my view, contrary to all reason in recent years, when Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe we must reform our agricultural policy.

<seg id=954>
We intend to introduce a system of safe and it is clear that is based on social criteria, in my opinion, the rapporteur has done an excellent job which shows that the Administration is much when it has a clearly defined purpose, as is the case.
</seg>
<seg id=955>
On the one hand, the most important producers, or those who are integrated with the production companies, it would take no part in this system, preferring to the who already have systems: individual savings bank loans, compensation fund.
</seg>
<seg id=956>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that in principle I welcome the Commission' s proposal to create a fund regulation, also in the context of the Austrian agriculture.
</seg>
<seg id=957>
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
</seg>
<seg id=958>
I understand that there is a desire to make the organisation of the market in the intensive farming and the collapse of the agricultural policy when it is linked to the earth, when we are talking about an extensive production.
</seg>
<seg id=959>
There is already a organisation of the market and we should not make the mistake of calling into question the organisation of the market, since in general terms has the desired effect.
</seg>
<seg id=960>
In the opinion of the Commission is fully justified that only require greater rigour to farmers who take part in the Fund regulation, because at the end of the day they receive a stable income to change, while those which do not belong do not receive any compensation.

The appeal from the Value Added Tax represented 36% and the traditional own resources amounted to 15% of the total.

Another element of the reform is faithfully with one of the fundamental priorities identified by the Court is whether to attach greater importance to the measurement of the results and the action within a framework of allocation of resources to be consistent with the priorities and the predetermined objectives that are clearly defined and can be measured.
</seg>
<seg id=964>
This is good and I would like to thank you sincerely, Mr Karlsson, like the members of the Court of Auditors and its services, the support given to the reform of the Commission in its report.
</seg>
<seg id=965>
In this context and given its proximity, I too would like to remind you that, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed an amendment to the Treaty to allow for the creation of a European Public Prosecutor' s office to pursue fraud to the detriment of the Community' s financial interests, I sincerely hope that the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice is not limited to take note of the proposal or scrap, but it is discussed seriously.
</seg>
<seg id=966>
The reality, as laid down the annual report is rather disappointing.

The Commission and the Member States should look from this angle and use the results of the report as a tool to improve their performance in the management of the finances of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=972>
I know that this report and the role which Parliament is about to embark in the context of the discharge will help to increase the monitoring with regard to the Community expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=973>
At the moment, Madam President, I would like to remember and hope that someone from the Council come here.
</seg>
<seg id=974>
The Court, as we did in previous years, has not said exactly where there have been failures.
</seg>
<seg id=975>
Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union on and the Court of Auditors' report makes it clear that even a hard work should be done in the applicant countries.
</seg>
<seg id=976>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, recently we came to an agreement with the Court of Auditors for which we could receive information from the Court of Auditors in advance with absolutely confidential and we agree that the maintain effectively in silence.

<seg id=977>
I would also like to address the Council and to ask why no progress is being made with regard to Article 24 of the Financial Regulation.
</seg>
<seg id=978>
Can a bit of common sense of the European Union should contribute to the resolution of the problem and to put George Bush in the place of history that deserves - into the dustbin!
</seg>
<seg id=979>
We must not find scapegoats, either in our institutions or in our Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=980>
Firstly, with regard to the procedure presentation of the annual report to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary control, I am pleased to hear the words reassuring honourable Members that the situation this year is more satisfactory than in previous years.
</seg>
<seg id=981>
But we will have the opportunity to discuss all of this.
</seg>
<seg id=982>
When it is important, from the point of view of taxation, we mention everything that needs to be mentioned.
</seg>
<seg id=983>
Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have noticed, the final part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has suffered the consequences of the interference of a malhadado virus between his speech and this House.

<seg id=984>
Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18 relate to issues, for example, in the United Kingdom and it has to be said that all the groups in the United Kingdom, are Socialists, popular or Greens have defended with great vehemence and have been adopted in the Committee on the Environment.
</seg>
<seg id=985>
Mr President, in March of this year we adopted the directive on the funicular railways intended for the transport of people.
</seg>
<seg id=986>
We are of the view that should not be passed on to the trade the manufacturer' s obligations laid down in the legislation on the safety of products.
</seg>
<seg id=987>
We have heard the justifications in favour of them and in favour of repeating the arguments of the sector that we hear in committee.
</seg>
<seg id=988>
The seller should be sufficient report the buyer on the nature of the products and on the scant information at its disposal on them.
</seg>
<seg id=989>
Finally, a question to the European Commission in relation to Article 4 with regard to European standards, and the question as to whether these rules should be made public.
</seg>
<seg id=990>
I am pleased with the exceptions which are included for the institutions establishments and not-for-profit charitable organisations, and for the articles which are marketed as second-hand articles in car boot sales or by private individuals.
</seg>
<seg id=991>
The reliability in the safety of products and after-sales assistance are added value for the European label in a particularly difficult time and decisive.
</seg>
<seg id=992>
When in another context we are asking the Commission to come forward with a proposal for the safety of services, it is incomprehensible that now try to be jointly regulated aspects relating to services, instead of waiting for the Commission to present its proposal, in fact, it is certainly likely that there will not be problems of demarcation of the scope of application of the different rules and legal uncertainty will increase over time.
</seg>
<seg id=993>
I would like to say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=994>
We have also provided for the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular, the candidate countries: the simplification of procedures to introduce emergency measures at Community level, so that we can intervene quickly as a result of the opinion of a regulatory committee.
</seg>
<seg id=995>
This new requirement is no responsibility substantial additional shops in the case of this kind.
</seg>
<seg id=996>
Replacing the word producer "with" provider , as proposed in amendment No 11, would create more confusion than clarity, since there is no definition of provider in the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=997>
Although the Commission is in favour of creating a network as soon as possible, this point must be agreed between the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=998>
This certificate can always be used to provide evidence, but it cannot be regarded as a litmus test in itself.
</seg>
<seg id=999>
Having explained in detail the reasons why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34 and part of amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and part of Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, because they are an improvement and clarification of the Commission' s proposal.

Of course, to Mr Barón Crespo, if it is Italian Socialist cannot be form part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.

I believe that there is no conflict between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.
</seg>
<seg id=1002>
With regard to the order of the vote, I leave it to the decision of the President, I should also like to point out that, in any case, I am against the three amendments.

<seg id=1003>
The non-Community Mediterranean countries face, there is no doubt, particularly serious problems relating to the economic development. acrecientan regional inequalities constantly.

<seg id=1004>
With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, for the sake of a harmonised European policy on immigration, in addition to the legal instruments to ensure fair treatment, it would be necessary to create instruments of financial aid in favour of all those young people who, having completed a cycle of higher studies or university in the countries of Europe, want to return to their countries of origin to start to exercise a professional activity.
</seg>
<seg id=1005>
I would like to single out one factor, which I consider to be very decisive in this matter, the lack of equality in the workplace.
</seg>
<seg id=1006>
Although late in the day, the Commission presented the programme relating to the Community framework strategy on equality between men and women (2001-2005), which creates highly of the previous and, in particular, of the fourth action programme which expires at the end of this year.
</seg>
<seg id=1007>
On the one hand, because have been taken into account various proposals for improvements tabled by my group and, on the other, because it insists on the need to review the situation of women in the national labour markets and a lack of access to social security systems on the basis of statistics drawn up on the basis of data representative and broken down according to gender.
</seg>
<seg id=1008>
- (I) my party has serious reservations with regard to apply Community law to the sale of consumer products, as well as on the refusal to implement the concept of mutual recognition of standards.
</seg>
<seg id=1009>
Now we understand and the Labour amendments offer the guarantee that these shops will remain intact and will be exempt from the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1010>
Finally, amendment No 15 is a free hand to the Commission with regard to the language regime of the agency, which we consider to be very worrying.
</seg>
<seg id=1011>
The simplification of procedures, the creation of decision-making bases of decentralised operations (Not only in Pristina, where it has acquired the significance of the separation of Yugoslavia), the treatment of the dual structure between the Council and the Commission, administration can be positive movements in the direction of tackle the great bureaucratic inadequacy of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
</seg>
<seg id=1012>
We are therefore voting against both of the Commission' s proposal and Parliament' s report.
</seg>
<seg id=1013>
Therefore, it seems justified adapt Community rules in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1014>
In addition, the fund offers the possibility of administrations more or less hidden aid in the form of cofinancing by the Member States.

<seg id=1017>
Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress in certain plans and that there are positive signs.

<seg id=1018>
Since 1987 this House had started the path of recognition, and the adoption of this amendment demonstrates the coherence of the Parliament in this debate.
</seg>
<seg id=1019>
The Union must do more proposals and consider enlargement to include Turkey as a essential geopolitical strategy.
</seg>
<seg id=1020>
These ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.

For several years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have seen the operation of one of these regional organisations, NAFO organisation (The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries), involving the states in the region, including Canada, as well as all those who use in this place traditional fishing areas, including France, Spain and other European countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1022>
Will not be at all satisfied until its cañoneras fleet, fly the flags of the "ring of stars" , monitor the implementation of its policies on fisheries.
</seg>
<seg id=1023>
The important thing is not, therefore, meet the Commission' s desire for hegemony and weaken Europe' s position, which would be in contradiction with the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity.
</seg>
<seg id=1024>
Finally, following difficult negotiations came to defend a worthwhile result.
</seg>
<seg id=1025>
The aim of this proposal, which aims to replace three directives on the incineration of waste is to improve the quality of the air, water, soil, the health of the people, by reducing emissions of pollutants linked to the activities of incineration and co-incineration and, above all, dioxins and furanes and heavy metals.
</seg>
<seg id=1026>
However, I also think it is important to stress as innovation that this is not just now emissions into the atmosphere but also to waters and emissions.
</seg>
<seg id=1027>
The proposal has been improved during its preparation.
</seg>
<seg id=1028>
The introduction of much stricter limits NOx emissions for the new co-incineration plants, such as the cement kilns, is another step forward which will serve as the incentive for the reduction of emissions, despite the fact that the proposed rules do not reflect the best available techniques.
</seg>
<seg id=1029>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise - especially to Mr Blokland, for having arrived a few minutes late.
</seg>
<seg id=1030>
In conclusion, this directive is an important contribution to the reduction of the harmful effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health.
</seg>
<seg id=1031>
The European Parliament is to be met, on behalf of discrimination and the fight against the exclusions and in respect of the responsibilities of each, to give a strong boost to the creation of a mechanism which will enable there is specifically the essential principle of solidarity.
</seg>
<seg id=1032>
There are, however, major differences between the various countries of the Union, and there are no detailed statistical data comparable to be able to see reliable what is in force in each country, what is - and where - what works better, what the weaknesses are, and so on, which is why, in fact, in my opinion, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary policy, underlines the need, before legislate Community rules on supplementary insurance disease, for the Commission to draw up a green paper to collect and sistematice all these data now dispersed and all the information on this.
</seg>
<seg id=1033>
Until now, this issue has been regarded as taboo to some extent.
</seg>
<seg id=1034>
There is a danger that due to the presence of serious risks citizens with health problems and the elderly can only recruit limited private insurance, which is incompatible with the social development.
</seg>
<seg id=1035>
The second point of view illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial intention and shared by many colleagues is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct necessary to introduce, between insurers, forms of mutualización costs - guaranteeing to all the provision of good quality health care - and to avoid the risk of develop discriminatory practices, as well as a selection of the risks and customers.
</seg>
<seg id=1036>
I think it is quite wrong that the money will be the determining factor to be first in line.
</seg>
<seg id=1037>
The new proposal from the Committee on employment and social affairs we think it is right: firstly an inventory is produced in a Green Paper and then decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation.
</seg>
<seg id=1038>
Today, in the Netherlands is taking place a debate on the introduction of structural changes in the system.
</seg>
<seg id=1039>
This is the basis of which has an initiative from the Commission to draw up and provide concrete test can become guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1040>
That is why it is unlikely that the answer is a single solution and absolute for all medical insurance.
</seg>
<seg id=1041>
I therefore believe that we must opt for the content of the report by Mr Rocard, whom we congratulate the Commission, which calls on the provision of a service, a Green Paper which will enable us to be aware of the current state of insurance in the Member States and also define the future.
</seg>
<seg id=1042>
Both are on a three-pillar model: the State and private business.
</seg>
<seg id=1043>
As regards supplementary pensions, the European Union has already produced a series of rules, which has been done through the drafting of a Green Paper which follows a draft directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1044>
Mr President, I would like to express my thanks and congratulations to Mr Rocard for his report and congratulate Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1045>
This study can form the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament to propose initiatives or measures.
</seg>
<seg id=1046>
With regard to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, I can say with pleasure that all have been incorporated.
</seg>
<seg id=1047>
We have supported the characteristic features of the programme, such as the multidimensional treatment of the phenomenon, the measures on health, education, housing, coherence and complementarity with other policies related, as well as the participation of non-governmental organisations, and of the very people affected by social exclusion.
</seg>
<seg id=1048>
This means that we must take advantage of the bottom-up stages of the cycle to restore a balance or surplus situation.
</seg>
<seg id=1049>
In this regard simply remind you that the last Ecofin Council has requested of the Commission, as from next year, be included in the assessment of the stability programmes precisely this long-term aspect of public finances on the ageing of the population.
</seg>
<seg id=1050>
One of the positive characteristics of the programme of the Netherlands is the special attention paid - as I said earlier - the impact of the ageing of the population in public finances over the next few years.
</seg>
<seg id=1051>
For this reason, the resulting budget for the year 2000, in the German case, will give a surplus of one point and the situation of the gross domestic product.
</seg>
<seg id=1052>
If we add to this the development of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have had a clear negative impact in terms of inflation.
</seg>
<seg id=1053>
Van also make a public distribution system compatible with private capitalisation systems and, of course, are compatible with support for the creation of specific investment funds can obtain tax advantages in the long term and that they can help to address the problem of ageing.
</seg>
<seg id=1054>
The third principle that guides us, then, is the precautionary principle.
</seg>
<seg id=1055>
It should be remembered that several regulatory proposals are currently under discussion, which will help to strengthen the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism and, therefore, I hope, the confidence of consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=1056>
However, this relatively low incidence is no reason to be satisfied.
</seg>
<seg id=1057>
Frankly, I am disappointed that in the statement yesterday Prime Minister Jospin had no recognition of the positive role played by the Community in recent years.
</seg>
<seg id=1058>
There is a clear need to find explanations to the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1059>
The Commission' s Food and Veterinary office already gives absolute priority to the controls of the Member States in relation to the protection measures against BSE.
</seg>
<seg id=1060>
With regard to their security, let me repeat that there is already a wide range of controls in place to ensure that animal meal do not represent a threat of transmission of BSE.
</seg>
<seg id=1061>
Yes, though it may be difficult to believe, it took four years to adopt a measure that I consider it essential for the protection of public health.
</seg>
<seg id=1062>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to demand explicitly that the Council made public, finally, its opinion on the regulation on BSE.
</seg>
<seg id=1063>
In this situation, the only way to break the circle of transmission of BSE is the total ban to use animal meal in animal feed.
</seg>
<seg id=1064>
In this regard, I would like to say that the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted.
</seg>
<seg id=1065>
Policies must change this state of affairs to the real responsible for this crisis are penalised and necessary decisions can take a first step in order to put an end to this dramatic crisis.
</seg>
<seg id=1066>
Would therefore, I review.
</seg>
<seg id=1067>
The labelling of beef which has been adopted, which is a minimum labelling and which entered into force only two and a half months ago, makes it impossible to trace the origin of the animals properly and have banned the specified risk materials very late in the day.
</seg>
<seg id=1068>
The public must be fully informed of the characteristics of the test to which I have referred.
</seg>
<seg id=1069>
At the time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, did nothing or almost nothing, as their counterparts nor did nothing about the consequences of Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic, nothing about the contaminated blood, provided for the same reason: not panic among the public.
</seg>
<seg id=1070>
The French ban will lead to an enormous increase in the demand, but the stocks of this products are limited.
</seg>
<seg id=1071>
Consumers have lost confidence, and to contain this phenomenon is necessary to generalise the BSE tests to cattle and sheep.
</seg>
<seg id=1072>
In the Commission' s proposal is now much more important to ensure that animal meal meet the highest safety standards.
</seg>
<seg id=1073>
Moreover, I fully agree - for once and without setting a precedent - with the ladies colleagues have said Ainardi, Auroi and Mrs Grossetête.
</seg>
<seg id=1074>
Well, ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, have a financial basis enough to carry out a sound policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1075>
We must tackle it. Mr.

<seg id=1076>
Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here in this hemicycle, which, at all costs, it is necessary to change the CAP.

I think it is very exemplary that France has been quick to take this step.

But these are not aid!
</seg>
<seg id=1081>
That is why I am surprised that in these circumstances to continue to be able to use or processed bodies.
</seg>
<seg id=1082>
The Phillips report on BSE has recently been published in the United Kingdom.
</seg>
<seg id=1083>
I would suggest that the European Commission also apply the precautionary principle with regard to the beef France.
</seg>
<seg id=1084>
We need to know today, because we are still in the dark, what the scientific data, what are the measures to be taken.
</seg>
<seg id=1085>
Moreover, I have heard all these proposals; I am not insensitive to them.
</seg>
<seg id=1086>
If representatives of the Member States come and tell me that legislation has not been implemented in its entirety, perhaps we should rethink the issue but we will not do so because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because there are gaps in compliance with the law in the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1087>
The best way of not hear us is not invite us; in any event, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1088>
The Commission considers that for the clarification and the coordination of these policies readmission agreements play an important role and at the moment the first agreements are currently under negotiation Community readmission with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.

What proposals does the Commission in this area on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?
</seg>
<seg id=1090>
(The President cut the speaker off)
</seg>
<seg id=1091>
The aim during this period has been reducing the public deficit to achieve a more acomodante monetary policy, lower interest rates and a more growth.

Subject: State aid to the audiovisual sector in a seminar of the French Presidency industries related to culture, a representative of the Directorate-General for competition of the European Commission said that the legal obligations of investment imposed on the television channels are state aid by the fact that these investments are imposed on a compulsory basis by the legislator.
</seg>
<seg id=1095>
It must be respected and protected .
</seg>
<seg id=1096>
This does not, however, it is clear, as the new growth is very truly unequal and can be accompanied, as we have seen in the United States, during the last ten years, as well as by other phenomena persistent exclusion, poverty, insecurity, urban ghettización.

The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition, which is also truth is something simple and too commonplace.

There has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of the social and structural reforms.
</seg>
<seg id=1105>
This is a problem of a legal nature, since, according to the wording of the Treaty, we can only the reference to social exclusion and poverty.
</seg>
<seg id=1106>
In my opinion, these proposals are a pragmatic response to your question.
</seg>
<seg id=1107>
But agree on the strategy does not necessarily mean agree the details.

If we define a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the various systems that have to comply with these requirements should have a longer period of evidence.

Renewable energy sources are not going to be a panacea for solving this problem, but there is no doubt that, in large part, can help to improve the situation and also to diversify the sources of energy and to reduce our dependence on hydrocarbons, which on the other hand we would nothing wrong.

<seg id=1110>
I will repeat three of our demands.
</seg>
<seg id=1111>
The establishment of realistic targets will without doubt to increase the confidence of the citizen in energy policy to be applied.

The controversy on the renunciation of nuclear energy, for example in Sweden and Germany, has revealed that unless there are on the horizon ecological energy alternatives that are viable at a competitive price, the debate is doomed to failure.

For this reason, the Member States should have binding targets.
</seg>
<seg id=1119>
Therefore, I am optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy sources, always provide the necessary incentives.
</seg>
<seg id=1120>
I believe that it would be a value to put constantly to renewable energy sources in the place they deserve.

A very strong rise in the price of oil, of course, puts us more acute to the problems associated with our dependence on fossil energy sources energy.

Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions enables citizens to control the governing bodies of the EU and encourages greater efficiency.

I believe that a fifth important amendment is the annual report must especially examine the documents that need to be secret or, at least, are kept secret.
</seg>
<seg id=1149>
This issue is ambiguous, and it is also possible that come and more restrictive rules are in force, which is why we have tabled amendments on this point, among others.

I am delighted that Parliament has been able to create a large majority in favour of greater openness.
</seg>
<seg id=1154>
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for this excellent work.
</seg>
<seg id=1155>
Mr President, access and transparency in the European Union do not enjoy good reputation.
</seg>
<seg id=1156>
If so, is a mistake, because it is the credibility and reliability of the European Union to the citizen.
</seg>
<seg id=1157>
Documents are a great deal today and we would like to ensure that there is the widest possible access to the different types of documents from the most varied ways possible.
</seg>
<seg id=1158>
Mr President, the Commission' s position with regard to public access to documents can be seen in the internal manual was sent on 11 October the employees of the Commission to inform you of how to deal with the applications for public access to documents tabled by members of the European Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1159>

The normal way in which develops cooperation at international level with the rules of the game and uses diplomacy, that is to say, that everything is carried out with the smoke-screens reductions, there is no point in the modern cooperation that the EU has developed.

Should not be confused with the role of the European Parliament or with the future interinstitutional agreements.
</seg>
<seg id=1162>
I believe that we have taken a step forward towards the exercise of the right of the citizen to information and knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1163>
However, it is not the only whom I thank, thank you very much deserves Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen of the PPE-DE Group, which was the author of the proposal under the strict application of the Hughes procedure.

I must admit that the great challenge in this regulation is the precise definition of the documents.
</seg>
<seg id=1168>
I would like to stress that, at the time, in practical terms, the Commission could accept all the amendments, such as the 9, 18, 21 in part, 23, 25, 26,1, 28 (F), 35, 38, 40,1, 40,6, 41,1, 42, 43,1, 47, 49 and 52.
</seg>
<seg id=1169>
I should like to vote in occasions in favour of the proposals put forward by the Commission, and to this end it is necessary that Members have the list of amendments that the Commission can support and the list of that you do not want to support.

<seg id=1171>
Finally, and most controversial, the committee made a strong call for the use of a fast-track procedure for the implementation of this legislation.
</seg>
<seg id=1172>
These amendments replace a number of other proposals in the report which will probably be rejected in the vote and they will then be replaced by these new amendments resulting from this consensus.
</seg>
<seg id=1173>
Mr President, in view of the excellent vote to support this report and given the response from the Commission this morning, of course, if you look at all the parts on which we have voted - which, under rule 2 (69) of the Rules of procedure, that we should defer the vote on the draft legislative resolution in order to be able to embark upon fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1174>
Mr President, I am sorry if I said that the PPE-DE Group also had requested that the vote be postponed, but its coordinator came up and told me that they wanted to postpone the matter to the November II session, rather than voting now.
</seg>
<seg id=1175>
The reason why I would suggest that we postpone the vote is that - as Mr Goebbels has pointed out - this is a very important issue.
</seg>
<seg id=1176>
I do not know how much it costs the roll-call vote, but it is, of course, hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, of our budget.

It is on provisions such as consumers will be reassured and farmers hear the message of solidarity that we wish to convey to you.
</seg>
<seg id=1181>
We must, as a matter of urgent priority, go further: promote a change in the common agricultural policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1182>
The ban on using animal meal in animal feed is only the first step in this direction.
</seg>
<seg id=1183>
We regret greatly, on the contrary, that the amendments tabled by our Group were not adopted.
</seg>
<seg id=1184>
I believe that it would be sensible to reduce the working hours of people working in companies that pollute.

<seg id=1185>
I shall conclude insist again on the fact that the generalisation of the exploitation of hazardous waste must not lead us to put up with the production of such waste.

<seg id=1188>
I therefore give my unreserved support to the proposal to set in motion a process of Luxembourg (A) in the field of social exclusion, including guidelines and national action plans.
</seg>
<seg id=1189>
In fact, the report calls for setting qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.
</seg>
<seg id=1190>
In presenting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is complying with the request of the Council to present by June 2000 a "initiative for cooperation in this field" .
</seg>
<seg id=1191>
Mr President, I have abstained for a very specific reason: this report, in my view, has not done from the ecological point of view, these progress that I hoped and auguraba.
</seg>
<seg id=1192>
I trust that this system is extended to all the cities of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1193>
Parliament' s proposals are realistic and cannot count on my support.
</seg>
<seg id=1194>
We must also be able to achieve better in the future be publicly known the existing good practices.
</seg>
<seg id=1195>
The people who have high income and are aware of the environment have the freedom to choose a cleaner energy within a free market, while the rest is still not be able to choose.
</seg>
<seg id=1196>
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
</seg>
<seg id=1197>
These three reasons are as follows: firstly, because is in the process of consolidating democracy and the deepening of the requirement of respect for human rights, particularly in relation to the indigenous peoples.
</seg>
<seg id=1198>
Mr President, we wish to express in this debate, as has been said by other Members who have spoken before me in the use of the word, the solidarity and support of our institution the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting for priority to be maintained in the area of the European Union' s external relations with the countries of Latin America.
</seg>
<seg id=1199>
I do not have the reservations which he has been able to express our colleague and friend, the chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1200>
Finally, in the dialogue with the centroamericanas authorities, the Commission is also by reiterating the importance to be given to the process of regional integration as an instrument to consolidate the democratisation and development in the area.
</seg>
<seg id=1201>
To cling to power has not hesitated to take the obsessive debate on the marfilidad, resulting in a wave of xenophobia: hatred of another abroad, from Burkina or the Malian and yet there are many working and living in the territory of Côte d'Ivoire for long years.
</seg>
<seg id=1202>
The establishment of a true democracy in Côte d'Ivoire it will not be possible without the creation of an independent commission of inquiry of the crimes committed, and without the official commitment to respect human rights and civil peace.
</seg>
<seg id=1203>
Some believe that the importance of democracy is on when it comes to Africa, which are complex procedures, which must be given time at the same time, however, I believe that there is no possible commitment to democracy and the question today to Côte d'Ivoire is the same as that arises for example to Guinea, when we now know that there are people in prison and that there is a democratic system.
</seg>
<seg id=1204>
I shall conclude with the following question: there are dictatorships, Mr President, just because there are people who suffer from misery, who do not have access to information, which do not have access to knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1205>
It would be illogical that the European Union required today the holding of new presidential elections in which might be able to take part, this time, all the candidates.
</seg>
<seg id=1206>
This is in many parts of Africa with the more various religious and ethnic mixtures.
</seg>
<seg id=1207>
These elections must allow the representation at national level of the political parties that were excluded in the presidential election and compensate for, if only partially, the imperfections of this first choice.
</seg>
<seg id=1208>
On the situation in Burma
</seg>
<seg id=1209>
They are doing a great offensive against the Shan people and against the Karen people and, according to the UN rapporteur has said, there is no sign of dialogue between the SPDC and the national League for Democracy.
</seg>
<seg id=1210>
Therefore, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.
</seg>
<seg id=1211>
I hope that by giving priority to this issue as an urgent matter, this Parliament will send a clear message to the people of Burma that their plight is not forgotten and that we recognise that the situation in Burma is getting worse rather than better and we are determined to try to do something about it.
</seg>
<seg id=1212>
It has been a long time be achieved.
</seg>
<seg id=1213>
In Asia is a danger that the economic and political reforms desacoplen, of that there can be economic progress and economic liberalisation without liberalisation in the political field and without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that without the rule of law that works, trade, subsidies and investment will be lost in the long term.
</seg>
<seg id=1214>
Mr President, I agree with my predecessors on the floor with many essential points of what has been said today, as much of what is happening in Vietnam is not acceptable.
</seg>
<seg id=1215>
However, now says human Rights Watch, to which Mr Swoboda referred, which Vietnam has given at the last time some steps to improve the situation in relation to human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1216>
These extremely secret documents provide us with a strange look behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese administration.
</seg>
<seg id=1217>
The Commission remains convinced, however, that can only be achieved a lasting solution to the current situation through a dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities.
</seg>
<seg id=1218>
There are also clear pressure the Vietnamese authorities to its own press has a system of self-censorship.
</seg>
<seg id=1219>
In accordance with the order of the day, it is now the debate on the following motions for resolutions:
</seg>
<seg id=1220>
We need also that the EU give aid and assistance, not only in the south-west but in all the areas that have been affected.
</seg>
<seg id=1221>
I would ask you all to support our resolution.
</seg>
<seg id=1222>
It is a matter of urgency that the Union is not limited to deploy extraordinary actions when disasters have already happened.
</seg>
<seg id=1223>
The Commission has taken two initiatives in this respect.
</seg>
<seg id=1224>
Mr President, there has been a purely linguistic mistake by introducing one of the amendments in the joint resolution.
</seg>
<seg id=1225>
The vote on its delay means postponing the task to the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1226>
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
</seg>
<seg id=1227>
The report is based on the fact that an ever increasing proportion of the insurance in Europe is covered by insurance complementary.
</seg>
<seg id=1228>
I think it is odd that we wish to organisations to the Commission for a proposal for a directive, but at the same time ask him a Green Paper on the current state of the voluntary associations and medical insurance complementary.
</seg>
<seg id=1229>
At a time when the ageing population dramatically, it is crucial that we try to improve the health system for the people of the whole of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1230>
We could not contribute to this.
</seg>
<seg id=1231>
Mr President, there are strong arguments in favour of the fast track when it comes to implementing the results of the Basle review on banking capital adequacy.
</seg>
<seg id=1232>
Under these conditions, such an initiative would have exactly the opposite effect to the expected to impose our banking sectors additional obligations without guarantees compensation, despite the demands of this House, the Commission does not have any means to ensure that the banks of the European Union will no longer be subject to discriminatory treatment by the American authorities.
</seg>
<seg id=1233>
We must take care that Basle, moreover, does not produce that banks will cause a second burden a high demand more funds.
</seg>
<seg id=1234>
This first comment, I should like to point out that I believe that the economic operators also consider satisfactory the approach that has been giving these regulations on capital which reinforce the issues relating to the risk.
</seg>
<seg id=1235>
These are the first thoughts of how we could achieve a rapid legislative process to be controlled and efficient within the current rules of the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=1236>
And, indeed, the time has come to admit that the institution of the "European Ombudsman" is sufficiently developed and has already given sufficient evidence of maturity in order to have a own budget.
</seg>
<seg id=1237>
The group EPP/ED supports the position of the Committee on constitutional Affairs that the Ombudsman' s powers should be extended and the sooner the better, especially when it comes to the Ombudsman' s investigative powers laid down in Article 3 of the Decision of 1994.
</seg>
<seg id=1238>
An Ombudsman is of course limited by the rules governing the documentary secret, but it is good that the citizens know that he or she, as Ombudsman, can have access to the documents that they do not have.
</seg>
<seg id=1239>
The starting point of this report is ombudsmann' s recommendation to the Commission, in relation to this, which make it possible for the candidates access to their examinations already remedied with regard to the selection procedure organised by the same.
</seg>
<seg id=1240>
We believe that the institutions of the Community should carry out their recruitment procedures, and, indeed, all procedures, with the maximum openness and transparency to prevent the suspicion of partiality, injustice and administrative incompetence.
</seg>
<seg id=1241>
I am referring here to an amendment concerning the requirement of the indisputable proof of the development of an oral test, for example.
</seg>
<seg id=1242>
Our colleague, Mr Bösch, has already explained briefly here the amendments that have been made in this report.
</seg>
<seg id=1243>
Having asked the questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal opposition, I received concrete and detailed answers.
</seg>
<seg id=1244>
That is beginning to open the process of the transparent government and to do so.
</seg>
<seg id=1245>
First of all, in the tests that are made by the Commission, the corrections are always anonymously.
</seg>
<seg id=1246>
Of course I was talking about July 2000.
</seg>
<seg id=1247>
VOTE
</seg>
<seg id=1248>
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
</seg>
<seg id=1249>
To assess the directive on own resources of the credit institutions must be carefully weighed the various interests that are in conflict.
</seg>
<seg id=1250>
That emerged the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1251>
This is the position defended by the rapporteur and the European People' s Party shares.
</seg>
<seg id=1252>
The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union is such that there is a great need for cooperation between the different police forces beyond the borders of their own country.
</seg>
<seg id=1253>
It appears that the majority of those who have spoken so far considers that it is essential that the School has a permanent seat.
</seg>
<seg id=1254>
The interim but not precarious umpteenth decision regalito the Council often happens in this Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1255>
The rapporteur wishes to add the prevention of crime, the provision of services, innovation and the border surveillance and also wants to change the internal security in order to include the maintenance of law and order.
</seg>
<seg id=1256>
Those were the ideals that we proposed and that is the kind of State working.
</seg>
<seg id=1257>
I welcome the possibility of levelling down the standards of some Member States of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1258>
Since the initial ideas on this issue that were made at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to the Member States to action designed to develop what we could consider a European police culture underpinned by the highest standards of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens and effectiveness in the fight against crime.
</seg>
<seg id=1259>
This intention is that the Police College develop above all from an intergovernmental perspective.
</seg>
<seg id=1260>
For the reasons relating, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
</seg>
<seg id=1261>
- (SV) I have voted against the report on provisional establishment of the European Police College.
</seg>
<seg id=1262>
Certainly many of our courts are very slow and ponderosos, and it is very difficult to make act quickly in these matters.
</seg>
<seg id=1263>
Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, because that is linked to the Brussels II regulation, which does not include children whose parents are separated, as well as the children outside marriage.
</seg>
<seg id=1264>
My own mother was separation of this kind and abduction 85 years ago, and even talk about this.
</seg>
<seg id=1265>
Therefore, what I would like to say to Parliament is that in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil matters - whose approval we hope here at the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and top priority is given to the extension of the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, therefore, this regulation on the right to visit, covering without discrimination to the children of married couples and the unions.
</seg>
<seg id=1266>
We shall now proceed to the vote.
</seg>
<seg id=1267>
Today, sport - and it has to be said - is closely linked to other economic sectors, such as, for example, the industries of the audiovisual sector or the promotion and sale of products sports.
</seg>
<seg id=1268>
What we need is a flexible and intelligent way to interpret the current rules.
</seg>
<seg id=1269>
It is, strictly speaking, an attack on democracy, even if we avoid see things in this light.
</seg>
<seg id=1270>
That is why the Commission this waiting to receive an answer to your request for detailed information on the measures planned by the government of the United Kingdom.
</seg>
<seg id=1271>
This proposal was presented by the Minister for the Economy in a statement pre-presupuestaria made six months before the full presentation of the draft budget in the spring of 2001.
</seg>
<seg id=1272>
Once again, I think that what Mr Simpson has said has been extremely helpful to reassure us on the probable intentions of the UK Government.
</seg>
<seg id=1273>
The congestion are not only a waste of time, not only generate high costs, but for the environment are a problem, and that is why I think the British Government allocated really money to solve these problems, then all will be something of this, especially all the citizens of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1274>
We are practically the only oil producer of the European Union and yet we have higher prices of petrol, diesel high prices in comparison with any other country in Europe - in Britain pay GBP 1.20 per litre of diesel.
</seg>
<seg id=1275>
This item is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=1276>
The European Parliament must tell them that is on your side, and I propose, once again, that we express our solidarity with a minute' s silence and our emotion.
</seg>
<seg id=1277>
Madam President, it is to support it fully, since I am one of those who have asked for the inclusion of this point.
</seg>
<seg id=1278>
We have some important progress.
</seg>
<seg id=1279>
The EU will deepen its relations with all the important groups and also will be in contact with the new government of the United States as soon as possible.
</seg>
<seg id=1280>
Prescott on the agreement that he had produced, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet, but also, I believe, the majority of the other European ministers of the environment, public health and consumer policy - and this is my last question to the Commissioner - rejected?
</seg>
<seg id=1281>
It is to be feared that the momentum has been lost and the American negotiators change and may have to start again.
</seg>
<seg id=1282>
The forests have been this time, the major obstacle.
</seg>
<seg id=1283>
A part of the soil of the countries of the European Union will be at sea or desert as a result of the continuing warming to which they are subjected.

And the price of oil products under the high level of wealth.

I congratulate Commissioner Wallström for their efforts in The Hague and I wish you more successful.
</seg>
<seg id=1286>
Certainly was not reach an agreement to be a bad agreement, and in this case the American position was a cut-price position, totally unacceptable for Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1287>
Climate change have major consequences for the developing countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1288>
I would like to repeat in English: forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.

<seg id=1289>
Only this credibility will enable the European Union leading the position and action in the POPs VI "B" in Bonn.
</seg>
<seg id=1290>
We are going to have to do our own assessment of what happened and prepare documents to be in contact with the various parties and, of course, with the broad representation group.
</seg>
<seg id=1291>
Of course, the follow-up to the next COP6 or the continuation of the COP6 will be the ratification of an agreement within the Union.
</seg>

Before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I myself will be the next Sunday a ministerial conclave to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a sitting of the IGC, on Monday, on the occasion of the General Affairs Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1293>
The minimum number of Member States were to participate was to limit eight, and the appeal clause to the European Council, which is currently a genuine right of veto, then it will be replaced by a right of knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1294>
We should regret it, but I am obliged to make this observation.
</seg>
<seg id=1295>
The European Council will also discuss the progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=1296>
The European Council of Lisbon approved guidelines to promote a innovative and competitive European economy.
</seg>
<seg id=1297>
Consumer protection is a growing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that do not require more explanation.
</seg>
<seg id=1298>
We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=1299>
Unfortunately, the current text of the Conference is very complicated, very ambiguous and very long, with two protocols: however, despite this broad and this complicated, it is also very weak, has not made the simple answer is for the simple problem that we have a long time ago.
</seg>
<seg id=1300>
(Applause)
</seg>
<seg id=1301>
One was that the candidate Member States themselves should adopt and implement the "acquis communautaire" ; that is the task which we share.
</seg>
<seg id=1302>
We appreciate deeply the Charter of Fundamental rights and we want to do more than simply declamarla.
</seg>
<seg id=1303>
It is true that the text would have been better, and can be improved and pointed out after Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1304>
I find it unacceptable that a number of governments have refused outright to consider the possibility of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=1305>
You do not even want to have it in the Treaty and in evidence that this document, this exercise should set aside.
</seg>
<seg id=1306>
We will speak with a single and thankless vote in the WTO.
</seg>
<seg id=1307>
In view of the dubious prospects of success, it does not seem to me to be right bear the Intergovernmental Conference with another extremely complex and controversial issue.
</seg>
<seg id=1308>
I want to make an urgent appeal to the French Presidency in order to make every effort to remove this rejection, because it is extremely destructive.
</seg>
<seg id=1309>
In terms of commercial policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be examined carefully.
</seg>
<seg id=1310>
Although the previous Treaty some progress was made in the implementation of this formula, provided the absurd formula codecision unanimity in matters relating to citizenship, social security, workers' rights and also the cultural policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1311>
The approach to this issue is simple, on its own, clearly shows the failure of a policy of strengthening the links of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1312>
This is the situation in which we have locked for months in this Intergovernmental Conference, and the cause is that nobody renunciation of its plaything.
</seg>
<seg id=1313>
This year' s experience obliges us to say that the momentum which needs to be given to the process of constitutionalisation of the Union after Nice and looking to the future of Europe must not be left to the method, has already reserved negotiation between the representatives of the governments.
</seg>
<seg id=1314>
As Mr Prodi has just pointed out, if we do not adopt a rule on majority decision-making is an obstacle to fail.
</seg>
<seg id=1315>
In our debate today nothing was said on that aspect of subsidiarity, but it is very important.
</seg>
<seg id=1316>
We did, the 1995 enlargement happened, came the reflection group chaired quite rightly Carlos Wensterdorp, wine Amsterdam and now we are going to have Nice and we are still almost like, Mr President: giving way to the institutional issues, without finding solutions that will enable us to sell a ambitious task, which is that enlargement to 27.
</seg>
<seg id=1317>
Let us not add to the disappointment that will lead to the Nice Summit, if Nice, of course, it is futile, the disappointment caused to the peoples by our Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1318>
In the past, we are showing that this objective was achievable and, as a representative of a Member State that has benefited from a planned transition to accession, I hope a positive attitude to the achievement of an enlarged Europe and peace.
</seg>
<seg id=1319>
It has to be understood, however, that, if you the right of veto, also have the others.
</seg>
<seg id=1320>
But we must also make a first transition for Parliament to be elected in 2004, because at least some Member States join before the new Parliament is elected in 2004 or during your term of office until 2009.
</seg>
<seg id=1321>
The President-in-Office of the Council has dealt with the issue of closer cooperation and said that things are moving towards a consensus in this regard.
</seg>
<seg id=1322>
Mr President, at first sight, Nice is the necessary adjustments and the unresolved issues with a view to enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=1323>
If we had something of this mentality, if we were to do less emphasis on what is going wrong in this part of the world and were more emphasis on what is going well, we would be more fortunate that we are at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id=1324>
The majority decisions to be taken in the Council should not only apply to goods, but also to other related areas such as services, investment, intellectual property and competition, Article 1 (133) must be amended in this respect.
</seg>
<seg id=1325>
The European Parliament' s right of initiative would open the way for the arbitrariness of the political parties was also invading this extremely sensitive area.
</seg>
<seg id=1326>
Therefore, as one of you said, by referring to the American optimism and the way in which the Americans talk about themselves, we should also stress what works and what is on the move.
</seg>
<seg id=1327>
I would like to say also that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1328>
We have worked a great deal, but we are faced with this old problem, and I do not think that can start development by a single country, because we face, once again, in twelve of the fifteen Member States, to situations - national, political, democratic - very important.
</seg>
<seg id=1329>
Lastly, Mr President Mr Védrine, you have highlighted a tense situation too and has also been talk of some pessimism.
</seg>
<seg id=1330>
Will he take you, furthermore, general measures to enhance the safety of appropriate ways to prevent something similar happen again?
</seg>
<seg id=1331>
In my view, we have to take the appropriate precautions - something that we have not yet done - to the guests of this Parliament can be happy, without having to be frightened potential threats, to this end we must create the necessary technical conditions, both from the point of view of the organisation and from the point of view of safety.
</seg>
<seg id=1332>
Here, hospitality; there, hospitality and respect.
</seg>
<seg id=1333>
Thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.
</seg>
<seg id=1334>
The best tribute to Ernest Lluch and you would be to respect its message - diàleg in Catalan: can we offer all this opportunity the Basque people?
</seg>
<seg id=1335>
On the other hand, each one can, of course, to express their opinion.
</seg>
<seg id=1336>
(B5-0550/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy, to the Commission, on the political situation in Afghanistan and humanitarian aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1337>
When I speak of organisation I should also like to say that, in view of the enormous efforts undertaken by the European Union, it is logical that it is the responsibility of the same.
</seg>
<seg id=1338>
Secondly, you will see in the resolution the clear will of Parliament to base the security and defence policy on two pillars balanced: the civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, the military management, since both are complementary pillars.
</seg>
<seg id=1339>
- (FR) Mr President, bearing in mind the delay which we have been and also my obligations, I will try to shorten the speech I had prepared.
</seg>
<seg id=1340>
These relations are plasmarán specifically in meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the COPSI and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries candidate or allies.
</seg>
<seg id=1341>
Consider, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where it can be said that each has played their part to the full.
</seg>
<seg id=1342>
In this period we have had the United States widely informed of the progress under way under the European security and defence policy, which is a sine qua non for the same develops in harmony, as is the case at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id=1343>
In the European Parliament was presented the second edition of the European Union' s annual report on human rights. 13 December will be organised in Paris a forum dedicated to human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1344>
This policy, you say, does not have to ambition compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which today remains the basis of the collective defence of its members, or create a permanent European army.
</seg>
<seg id=1345>
On the other hand, although I mentioned the figure of 100,000 60,000 troops, this does not mean that ambicionemos overcome the objective laid down in Helsinki, but that we have a reserve in qualifications and different specialities, which makes it possible to ensure that would be achieved the men that correspond to the objective of the Council, beyond the operational conditions of their use.
</seg>
<seg id=1346>
Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, refer in short the profound political sense, adopted by a large part of our public opinions, this new task, through which Europe is a tool of political influence missing.
</seg>
<seg id=1347>
We are now facing the problem to ensure that, when we talk about consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe, we refer to the entire continent of Europe, because this is enlargement and the process of enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=1348>
We have to integrate three tracks etc. should into a coherent whole: Community policies, CFSP, including the ESDP, and national measures of the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1349>
Even with our laborious procedures of the Commission, we do not need a force of 60,000 soldiers to carry out our objectives.
</seg>
<seg id=1350>
Therefore, we need to set up an urgent solution of humanitarian aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1351>
While it is true that I do not agree with the cynics who say that Europe can with a new impracticable game, it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be clever in many situations.
</seg>
<seg id=1352>
The EU should not develop a defence system with regular troops.
</seg>
<seg id=1353>
Finally, I would like to express my group' s concern at the worsening situation in Afghanistan and urge the Commission and the Council to do their utmost to achieve a peaceful solution and to help the population, especially now at the entrance to the winter.
</seg>
<seg id=1354>
To put it simply: where, when and how to act the European intervention force.

May understand the terrible outcome of the last two months "intifada" : 270 10,000 dead, the Palestinian majority, and over injured, often baldados for life.
</seg>
<seg id=1356>
That is why its continued effort will serve to create an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction extremely gloomy.
</seg>
<seg id=1357>
Secondly, contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible or desirable for the European Union to do more than what is before the conflict and the escalation of violence which has taken place in the Middle East, especially now, in the transitional period in which are the United States.
</seg>
<seg id=1358>
Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on Mrs Lalumière' s report, which, in my view, is well prepared and clearly expressed.
</seg>
<seg id=1359>
There is a political concept and really not yet there is a common foreign and security policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1360>
The EU has only a problem, namely that so far has failed awaken the interest of the public by such measures despite the fact that they are much more sustainable and effective.
</seg>
<seg id=1361>
Mr President, then there is, of course,; how to share out this budget.
</seg>
<seg id=1362>
And I say this, despite the huge amount of apparent guarantees that have arisen on this matter miraculously over the last few days.
</seg>
<seg id=1363>
We should work together and in a coordinated fashion. we should move towards a better European policy acquisition of supplies in order to have a more efficient defence industry which offers greater value for money.
</seg>
<seg id=1364>
Even those who question the usefulness of the decision, for example, to create the so-called euro-army, must repair the important political dimension of this decision and its influence in the cohesion of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1365>
The first presence has been so historic a Defence Minister in this House we have reserved the evening session so that the impression is not too strong for our Members.
</seg>
<seg id=1366>
For all of them, a civil crisis management preventive is a means better than the military solutions.
</seg>
<seg id=1367>
Do you wish to Russia, in the long term, to participate in a political union with a democratic regime?
</seg>
<seg id=1368>
Therefore, Europe is not going to be a new alliance, as I have heard mention in an argument informed incomplete.
</seg>
<seg id=1369>
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to rule 5 (42) of the Rules of procedure, to wind up this debate.
</seg>
<seg id=1370>
Before the enormity of the task given to four committees and established a unprecedented procedure, with four parallel reports.
</seg>
<seg id=1371>
The whole of the measures proposed in the White Paper must agree to modernise and make effective operation of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1372>
Therefore, it would be appropriate for the reform outside the opportunity to limit your speech only in areas that do not involve expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=1373>
The differences of opinion that arose were not only of a political nature, but reflected even more the cultural differences between the fifteen Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1374>
The new internal audit service, under the direct responsibility of you, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform, will take as the main task the analysis of the functions and internal control systems within the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1375>
It has been a pleasure to work together and I believe that the process to address a crucial reform of the Commission, which is essential for the future of the European Union has had a depth and wealth added thanks to the participation of us four.
</seg>
<seg id=1376>
May have expectations of transfer to other European institutions, implementation of committees of services in the national administrations or work in the private sector.
</seg>
<seg id=1377>
In this way, our constitutional committee recalls membership of a strong, independent commission, efficient, transparent and politically responsible.
</seg>
<seg id=1378>
We in the Committee on Budgets consider that the establishment of activity-based budgeting causes us problems because of the lack of visibility of the expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.
</seg>
<seg id=1379>
This will, of course, the good will of this Parliament to carry forward this reform with the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1380>
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.
</seg>
<seg id=1381>
This is shameful if we take into account the fact that the EU is the first supporter of the modernisation of economic life.
</seg>
<seg id=1382>
Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, is that the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts there is still a global and coherent response with a view to a policy of government and not only to better management of the institution.
</seg>
<seg id=1383>
This change of attitude should be translated into the transparency of the administration.
</seg>
<seg id=1384>
From my point of view, there is a structure in the world of greater significance and fundamental: fifteen Member States and in the future twenty or more, a whole continent; the part of the industrialised world currently more late in the Union and, through it, the Commission through its structures.
</seg>
<seg id=1385>
The change is never easy.
</seg>
<seg id=1386>
In doing so, however, on behalf of the Socialist Group, we believe that the current functioning of the Community' s public administration is quite effective.
</seg>
<seg id=1387>
The result is that indicated by the commitment and the competence of the many members of the Commission and its administration.
</seg>
<seg id=1388>
Many thousands of requests for projects have been more than a year waiting for an evaluation.
</seg>
<seg id=1389>
The debate, as we have seen, is not so much of principles, objectives or opportunity to reform, the procedures pace timetable, possible problems or unintended consequences of its implementation.
</seg>
<seg id=1390>
I should like to begin by informing the House that at its meeting this morning, as Mr van Hulten pointed out earlier, the College has adopted a proposal for institutional agreement for the establishment of an advisory group on basic standards in public life, as provided for in the action 1 of the action programme of the White Paper.
</seg>
<seg id=1391>
In addition, these changes is clear that the only would be possible with an amendment to the Treaties.
</seg>
<seg id=1392>
The central objective is to achieve simplification, increase the transparency and strengthen the budgetary principles, that is to say, in particular less derogations, less special arrangements incomprehensible and increase the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure.
</seg>
<seg id=1393>
It is actually very uneconomic to the Commission that according to the contracts for X costs have to reimburse 20% to 30% costs and often get together and check the proof of very small sums.
</seg>
<seg id=1394>
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and cooperation, on the effectiveness of the European Union' s relations with the developing countries and the impact of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000/2051(INI)).
</seg>
<seg id=1395>
The latter affect in particular to the NGOs.
</seg>
<seg id=1396>
Of course, that is not enough, but everything must reach safe from the cartoons on the shortage of our development aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1397>
We this now because it is a good framework in itself.
</seg>
<seg id=1398>
Mr President, I have once again today in Mozambique where the European Union has been responsible for a brilliant humanitarian aid after the disaster of the floods, but, once again, the reconstruction projects, which we have already allocated money, are behind pending signatures in Brussels.
</seg>
<seg id=1399>
To these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.
</seg>
<seg id=1400>
We now have a harmonised scheme for Country Strategy Papers and indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1401>
In addition, the creation of the SEM failed to provide a solution to the continuing disparity between 8 exorbitant administrative resources.
</seg>
<seg id=1402>
- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the reason that had a very special interest to be with you today in this debate on the maritime first package in the European Parliament, is that you are going to examine three important texts, which are an essential first step on a subject that recent events have unfortunately placed in front page of today.
</seg>
<seg id=1403>
From the point of view of the presidency of the Council, this could afford to, on the other hand, to enter into discussions with the Member States an agreement on the basis of the proposals put forward by you, and adopt the text at first reading, with a qualified majority if necessary.
</seg>
<seg id=1404>
The rapid treatment and specialised has had the effect of the two Erika packages and six proposals has led to a huge boost.
</seg>
<seg id=1405>
The lesson that Parliament must retain this morning is that, of course, the maritime legislation is throughout the world in a state of uncertainty and we have to start the process of implementing it in order.
</seg>
<seg id=1406>
We must give a clear signal that the European waters and ports we are not going to tolerate vessels that do not comply with the standards.
</seg>
<seg id=1407>
For the small vessels, we adopted a position of compromise between the limit of 5,000 600 tonnes, raised by the IMO, and the proposed by the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1408>
These data should be made available to the European authorities, state and port, as well as the public concerned.
</seg>
<seg id=1409>
The cross-border nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can affect a region, bound to lead to the need for a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental pollution.
</seg>
<seg id=1410>
In cooperation in the field local organisations have been included for the protection of nature.
</seg>
<seg id=1411>
Amend the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, harmonisation of the legislation, particularly with regard to the selection of vessels subject to inspection and the scope of the different types of inspection is clearly positive.
</seg>
<seg id=1412>
I would like to point out once again that there is no urgency, in which you insist.
</seg>
<seg id=1413>
I believe that in the case of the limit the responsibility of the classification societies, regardless of what is decided today, the Council and Parliament must again to reflect together on this.
</seg>
<seg id=1414>
The black box, a black list and everything else are excellent ideas and we fully agree with them, but I would like to highlight a few points.
</seg>
<seg id=1415>
In the face of this catastrophic situation and anarchic maritime transport, Europe has accepted the challenge and eleven months after the Erika, the European Union will be in a position to announce that never any procedure has worked so quickly.
</seg>
<seg id=1416>
It is clear to what extent the logic of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is opposed to a high level of safety at sea.
</seg>
<seg id=1417>
Finally, regardless of the technical measures to be taken, one of the largest sources of uncertainty will continue to exist is all in the area of the channel and the North Atlantic, the exponential growth of traffic arising from excessive of the North Sea ports.
</seg>
<seg id=1418>
The current President of the Council have the situation in their own country.
</seg>
<seg id=1419>
Mr President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika have been tabled under political pressure a series of measures in order to increase the safety of ships at sea.
</seg>
<seg id=1420>
Some Greek ships collapsed without more, Mr Gayssot, without storms.
</seg>
<seg id=1421>
Thirdly, when we talk about reports of this kind, it seems to me that it is becoming clear that is not bound up the relationship between, on the one hand, the supply of oil and, on the other hand, the fact that it is used still fossil fuel.
</seg>
<seg id=1422>
Therefore have the political courage to our ecological ambitions.
</seg>
<seg id=1423>
This means that, in this field more than in any other, it is our responsibility, and that we must, in my view, silence any sign of institutional self-respect.
</seg>
<seg id=1424>
For example, to Finland is of the utmost importance that Russia sign these agreements.
</seg>
<seg id=1425>
This is the strengthening of the requirements for the construction of vessels oil, the improvement of the rules for the port controls and the more stringent rules for organisations of classification societies of vessels, which is a consequence of this.
</seg>
<seg id=1426>
Mr President, today we are debating maritime safety on the basis of three reports whose congratulate rapporteurs.
</seg>
<seg id=1427>
With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have shown in extremely short deadlines that Parliament is very determined to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, controls, the construction standards and intolerable that is similar accidents happen again.
</seg>
<seg id=1428>
Madam President, in the recent past a number of marine accidents considerable consequences, in particular those who were involved oil, have shaken our continent.
</seg>
<seg id=1429>
But 80% of accidents are linked to human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social order.
</seg>
<seg id=1430>
A parliamentary or parliamentary you used the word "traceability" .
</seg>
<seg id=1431>
The port state control directive is designed to monitor compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new rules.
</seg>
<seg id=1432>
Amendment No 18 introduces the port state control in relation to rest periods of seafarers, although the implementation of the provisions relating to the working hours of seafarers is already completely covered by Directive 99/95.
</seg>
<seg id=1433>
I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced in amendment No 21 a reference to the regime assessment of the conditions and agree with the proposal, but perspective is necessary adjustment wording to make it clearer.
</seg>
<seg id=1434>
Amendment No 4 and part of No 18 on the "kilograms" are not acceptable.
</seg>
<seg id=1435>
I can assure you that if a shipowner will include a ship in the register, after our proposal must think twice.
</seg>
<seg id=1436>
The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes, and in the meantime dozens and dozens of articles mentioned, and has rejected the Commission' s position.
</seg>
<seg id=1437>
Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council in relation to a range of actions relating to the trans-European network collection of creation and dissemination of the intra-European statistics on the challenges of goods and extra-comunitarios (EDICOM) (COM(00)0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201(COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)
</seg>
<seg id=1438>
However, by removing the resolution, I would like to express the conviction that, with a view to the Nice Council, Parliament would have done your voice heard devoting a specific resolution and different from the very important and difficult issues of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of treating them in the context of a single resolution which includes all the other items on the agenda of the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1439>
(Since more than twelve Members rose, the oral amendment was rejected) (Parliament adopted the resolution)
</seg>
<seg id=1440>
Report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries, and the impact of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000/2051(INI))
</seg>
<seg id=1441>
I have voted against to register my protest at the fact that the European Union can still act as should also in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1442>
Despite the fact that the amendment of the existing directive on the monitoring of vessels or the Watts report respond to the real needs, are steps in a positive sense, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.
</seg>
<seg id=1443>
We regret that the Commission' s proposal has not taken up the idea of the creation of a genuine European monitoring body, following the model of the "guards coast" in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id=1444>
- (EL) precondition for the safety of ships, for the protection of life at sea and the protection of the environment is the fight against the immunity of the enjoyed by the shipowners, the strict measures for the control of the situation of vessels and the imposition of strict penalties to shipping companies which violate the safety standards; also, improving the working conditions of workers in the Merchant Navy, and provide them with the appropriate training, as well as ensure organic compounds which respond to the growing needs of ships.
</seg>
<seg id=1445>
The rapporteur Hatzidakis, unfortunately, has done the opposite.
</seg>
<seg id=1446>
The sinking of the Erika, in December 1999, is at the root of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community policy agenda and was under pressure from the European Parliament and the Commission proposed the texts that we have voted today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck.
</seg>
<seg id=1447>
The current compensation funds have not been properly equipped and this has become more obvious in the case of the Braer disaster in the fishing industry of the Shetland Islands has not been properly compensated for their losses.
</seg>
<seg id=1448>
Madam President, I have already said that, a few years ago, I had the opportunity to navigate.
</seg>
<seg id=1449>
The rapporteur' s proposals relating to the harmonisation at European level are entirely positive.
</seg>
<seg id=1450>
This is an important paragraph because the classification societies of vessels.
</seg>
<seg id=1451>
It would be a great success, since the Europe that we need, on the eve of enlargement, it is not a rigid Europe, jerarquizada, remote, but a flexible Europe and close to the people, on the basis of respect for the national democracies.
</seg>
<seg id=1452>
The increasingly open fight for power between many Member States muddies the possibilities to achieve some compromise.
</seg>
<seg id=1453>
The most important task of Nice is to ensure that the EU to have efficient institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=1454>
A week of the summit, I personally have hopes.
</seg>
<seg id=1455>
I am not in favour of link automatically qualified majority voting and codecision and I believe that any initiative to extend the powers of codecision must be taken on a case-by-case basis.
</seg>
<seg id=1456>
To amend Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting, which is currently in force in the Council for the trade in goods to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.
</seg>
<seg id=1457>
In this way Parliament is the right of influence, is silence as a tribute to the partidismos, fidelidades national and governments and forget their obligations to the citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=1458>
I have also voted against a text which calls for the integration of the Charter of fundamental rights in the future Treaty adopted in Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1459>
It is a mistake divide the Union into two groups and that is why I cannot support the idea that a third of the Member States is leading the way.
</seg>
<seg id=1460>
Your new role has put an end to the neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.
</seg>
<seg id=1461>
In this report there are many things that the group of the Consevadores British can support, in particular the emphasis placed on the enlargement of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1462>
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have supported the report on the creation of a common European policy in the field of security and defence.
</seg>
<seg id=1463>
But also against the peoples of the European Union will have to finance, in any case, the new armament spending proposed in the report and will even have the guarantee that the military forces are not use one day against themselves, in the name of "policing" .
</seg>
<seg id=1464>
Just as serious is the pretence that a state which does not wish to take part in a mission is obliged to pay a financial contribution will the Member States involved in this war.
</seg>
<seg id=1465>
However, with military means outside is no solution, because this is not the removes the cause of the conflict and change public opinion.
</seg>
<seg id=1466>
· that military operations should be financed with a Community budget line and that the Member States have to contribute funds even if they did not wish to participate in operations (Paragraphs 49 and 50).
</seg>
<seg id=1467>
On the other hand, the EU would suit would invest the priorities of the Petersberg tasks and address the attention to humanitarian and civil options.
</seg>
<seg id=1468>
I support this report by my colleague Maj Britt Theorin.
</seg>
<seg id=1469>
But the needs are not mentioned in this category to give way to the demand for a tax deducibilidad domestic services and of a "adaptation of prices and costs to the financial possibilities of individuals" .
</seg>
<seg id=1470>
In fact, it is extraordinary that in the 21st century we have to recommend that the Member States should ensure for domestic employees the right to social security and a proper retirement.
</seg>
<seg id=1471>
For many young people, its first contact with the market can be a black work.
</seg>
<seg id=1472>
What is more serious is when it comes to women from distant countries, which have taken this type of work for need and which have no other means of earning a living on a lasting basis.
</seg>
<seg id=1473>
The reform of the Commission will be judged by the facts, hence the need for regular monitoring reports presented during the entire period of duration of the programme and the importance of the comprehensive assessment expected by December 2002.
</seg>
<seg id=1474>
In the recent past, various scandals and failures concluded, in March 1999, with the resignation of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1475>
In conclusion, I consider it to be essential to remember that through this reform, which is essential for the future, we hope at the same time rigour and transparency on the part of the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part, in the strict framework of its powers.
</seg>
<seg id=1476>
Conservatives we also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that we should ensure that democratic control and to allow operating the system of the three pillars.
</seg>
<seg id=1477>
(The sitting was closed at 13.15 p.m.)
</seg>
<seg id=1478>
We have received information - and I would like to add immediately that I cannot creerla at all - that the President-in-Office of the Council and head of the French Government is going to appear here tomorrow only 30 minutes to speak.
</seg>
<seg id=1479>
It therefore seems to me that we need to that we can have a well-considered position and the reasoning.
</seg>
<seg id=1480>
Whatever we do, we vote, and I am in favour of a resolution as suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1481>
In the course of the night work has been done in these texts and the figures relating to the distribution of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1482>
Madam President, I would urge that the agenda is not removed this report by Mr de Roo, because, as well as being very well prepared, at the last Council of Environment of the French Presidency, which will take place on Monday and Tuesday of next week, it is planned to prepare a common position on this matter.
</seg>
<seg id=1483>
Thank you, Mr Parish.
</seg>
<seg id=1484>
In the meetings of the Committee on foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy, in his capacity as chairman, feels there and smoked.
</seg>
<seg id=1485>
The political basis is clear: to harmonise the market respecting a high level of public health and consumer protection on the basis both in the existing regulations as well as the development of scientific knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1486>
Its quality is at stake and concept of life, in which the protection of the health is a very relevant weight.
</seg>
<seg id=1487>
This rule can also be applied to all drugs fun but dangerous, if no one else that the consumer can be affected.
</seg>
<seg id=1488>
Recently in the United States have won trials against the tobacco multinationals for poison and lying on the absence of toxicity of products.
</seg>
<seg id=1489>
We believe that the only one possible and consistent is to see an end to the export of cigarettes are prohibited in the EU for health reasons.
</seg>
<seg id=1490>
Instead of draw lessons from the failure in Luxembourg on 9 October, we insist in a legally indefensible attitude.
</seg>
<seg id=1491>
I have analysed carefully what the Commissioner said to my colleague, Mr Hume: there can be no massive losses of jobs in this sector.
</seg>
<seg id=1492>
Are the Parliament and the Council have to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, the appropriate legal basis for this.
</seg>
<seg id=1493>
Maaten and others - there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accepted the restrictive interpretation, as proposed by the leader of the European People' s Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be tying our hands to the legislative development of the Community institutions which is so important is for the development of Community law.
</seg>
<seg id=1494>
The weak point of this proposal is that it puts a lot of emphasis on the promotion of free competition.
</seg>
<seg id=1495>
In conclusion, since the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam the European Parliament has powers of coordination in environmental issues and consumer protection, and will work closely together, of course, with the Council and the Commission in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1496>
In fact this has nothing to do with tobacco, but the judgment of the Court of Justice could have been dictated also to ban the advertising of alcohol or the advertising of chocolate because, of course, the sugar can also be harmful to health.
</seg>
<seg id=1497>
I just do not understand why a majority of this Parliament wants to propose relax the rules relating to the export more than proposed by the governments of the Member States, the governments also represent the many industries referred to.
</seg>
<seg id=1498>
Is a proven fact that 80% of smokers to stop, but in the tobacco sector encourages very few policies to help these people to stop smoking.
</seg>
<seg id=1499>
If we insist to tell other countries what levels of public health must set spreading export our reasonable proposals for the internal market, we will be jeopardising all the good work done by Mr Maaten.
</seg>
<seg id=1500>
We are in favour of that there will be a test method recognised in all the Member States of the EU, to be carried out in a given country recognised in a laboratory of evidence.
</seg>
<seg id=1501>
Today is openly acknowledge the health effects of tobacco consumption, and both legislators and public opinion share the feeling that the time has come to adopt strict rules and regulations in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1502>
Consequently, the Community rules will fit perfectly into the future international agreements, thus avoiding the risk of obstacles to trade and at the same time strengthening the protection of consumers and guaranteeing a high level of health protection.
</seg>
<seg id=1503>
It would be preferable to wait until such time as it has dealt with the issue of additives as a whole in the first report of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1504>
With regard to the laboratory tests, the amendment with a view to the adoption of evidence is superfluous, since other article already provides for the movement of goods which comply with the provisions of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1505>
Madam President, this report is not complications: at the present time, the directives on summertime are only five years in force, and then have to come back to Parliament for its renewal.
</seg>
<seg id=1506>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the provisions on summer-time, that there are discussed, is a good proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1507>
I therefore believe that we in this House we should not deal with this issue too, because the Member States, as well as the population, have already accepted in the regulation of the summer time and this has been recognised as part of our annual rate.
</seg>
<seg id=1508>
In my view, it is important that issues of slots and with the application of summer-time regulations are, as provided for in the proposal, in the area of decision making in the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1509>
Would be more justified than summer-time money at the end of September, some six months of its beginning.
</seg>
<seg id=1510>
It can accept the appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report 2007 referred to Article 5.
</seg>
<seg id=1511>
The human germ line intervention is in clear that cannot be accepted.
</seg>
<seg id=1512>
In fact, I believe that an ethics committee in the working people that this does not work as a main profession, we can give a slightly longer term, but on the authorities should exert a certain amount of pressure of time to put to work quickly.
</seg>
<seg id=1513>
These groups should remain within the scope of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1514>
But I am also pleased that we have managed to take a cerrojazo to gene therapy.
</seg>
<seg id=1515>
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to reconcile the contrary positions.
</seg>
<seg id=1516>
These programmes are linked to the fight against cancer, with the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug dependence and the health promotion; and adjournment would mean an end to the projects and the work of the networks created for this purpose.
</seg>
<seg id=1517>
Is a very good thing to prepare the ground a priori, so that, in the event that it is not necessary to make a second reading, be very close the point at which decisions are taken.
</seg>
<seg id=1518>
In addition, we must take into account the fact that both the prevention and promotion and monitoring are becoming increasingly important and, therefore, we should give them more budgets and give them more important.
</seg>
<seg id=1519>
Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the extension of the existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about how and in what develops European policy in the field of public health.
</seg>
<seg id=1520>
I understand that the Council has also given its consent in principle.
</seg>
<seg id=1521>
In the European Union is currently the paradox that the abolition of internal borders to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must live with the maintenance of 15 borders in the areas police and judicial criminal, that the Member States in eliminating difficulties.
</seg>
<seg id=1522>
To conclude, the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European criminal justice area, albeit partial and limited, but responds to the real needs of a huge volume of European citizens who so far have been practically alone when they have been victims of a crime outside the territory of their homes.
</seg>
<seg id=1523>
What we have asked for this group of people?
</seg>
<seg id=1524>
At the same time, we must ensure that a special training professionals who will have to bear the costs of direct contact with the victims.
</seg>
<seg id=1525>
The victims must not become people doubly penalised, firstly because of a crime and then because of the system.
</seg>
<seg id=1526>
Also, in this regard it is important that they are report in a discreet manner and professional relatives, in other words, to the family of the victim of the facts if they so wish, and that they can count on the aid needed so that we do not have to know all through the press.
</seg>
<seg id=1527>
This is regardless of the crime has been committed.
</seg>
<seg id=1528>
Never, in the field of the Member States or in the Community, we need to abandon the principle that individuals must always take responsibility for their actions.
</seg>
<seg id=1529>
In other cases could be obtained the information we need in a language of the Union is not itself.
</seg>
<seg id=1530>
I am very glad Parliament' s positive response to the first text on such an important issue, so that the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building gradually can offer to our fellow citizens support in situations that often it is difficult to bear.
</seg>
<seg id=1531>
Vote on request for urgent procedure
</seg>
<seg id=1532>
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
</seg>
<seg id=1533>
In this way, during the night of 23 to 24 November we agreed with the Council on the main points of a budget that although it is not brilliant is reasonable.
</seg>
<seg id=1534>
That is why the Commission proposed a revision by EUR 300 million to what was tooth and nail the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1535>
But I also know from the discussions that is even more difficult to draw up a negotiable position of the Council, to obtain a mandate and ensure that the national self-interest cigars lead to a decision pan-European more or less reasonable and defensible.
</seg>
<seg id=1536>
I hope that the work on a recruitment common office, as stated in the modern German, that is to say a European Recruitment authority, move really so that we can overcome together the problems that will be raised in the next few years to all the institutions - the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - in other words, the need for staff of the next few years.
</seg>
<seg id=1537>
The Council refuses to carry out this revision - is that we should now have data - and I would like to prevent: using the flexibility instrument two years in a row, two consecutive years - indeed, in less than 600 months and the first of them less than six months of the adoption of the perspective - hurting financially the flexibility instrument since it prevents replenishment and possible accumulation, which is scheduled to up to million.
</seg>
<seg id=1538>
This amount so important that responds to the existence of very high needs in 2001, can be financed mainly thanks to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 200 million.
</seg>
<seg id=1539>
In view of this new element, the Council has voted at second reading a budget increased by 2.5%.
</seg>
<seg id=1540>
Finally, before you proceed to the final adoption of this budget, I should like to stress the support of the Council in respect certain rules basic budgetary reserve implementation of appropriations, legal basis and classification of expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=1541>
And in contrast to Nice, I believe that the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are very satisfied with the outcome in general.
</seg>
<seg id=1542>
Ladies and gentlemen, the new emergence of sick cows BSE did also need to act immediately in the budgetary sector, in particular for the protection of health, consumer protection and also for aid to farmers affected by this situation.
</seg>
<seg id=1543>
In addition, the Council has set for the framework programme for reconstruction aid in the Western Balkans a clearly indicative multiannual amount, which is compatible with this financial perspective.
</seg>
<seg id=1544>
With a great deal of effort, we had a couple of millions of euros.
</seg>
<seg id=1545>
I should like to thank Mrs Haug.
</seg>
<seg id=1546>
Think that that 1% of the budget of the European Union is very well spent.
</seg>
<seg id=1547>
You said, if I have understood you correctly, that we should not use the reserve, because it was a contravention of the rules.
</seg>
<seg id=1548>
I believe that we have seen very positive things together with many other that I am not going to mention now because of the pressure of time.
</seg>
<seg id=1549>
Despite the fact that expenditure on agriculture, which represent almost half of the total budget increase, once taken account of the letter of amendment, in more than 5%, the total increase of the budget is only 3.5%.
</seg>
<seg id=1550>
We see the great danger that, over the next few years, increase the confrontation between MEDA projects countries around the Mediterranean and the Balkans in spite of the fact that we all know that there is needed urgently money.
</seg>
<seg id=1551>
Satisfied to have overcome the difficulties that did so close the path towards the objective of comply with the commitments made in Helsinki with the candidate countries without undo the Union, to allow the Europe of tomorrow that it continues to operate effectively.
</seg>
<seg id=1552>
Are real, but not go as far as the presidency - which has shown, and I would like to point out that at national level, with a greater opening - I would have liked.
</seg>
<seg id=1553>
A new legal basis has been planned for the statute for European political parties and Parliament being granted the status of institutional plaintiff laid down in Article 230 of the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=1554>
The last few weeks three important achievements have been achieved.
</seg>
<seg id=1555>
This is the purpose of the declaration adopted in Nice and the deliberations to coordinate at European level the fight against doping.
</seg>
<seg id=1556>
Between the threats, is, as you all know, global warming.
</seg>
<seg id=1557>
In addition, in Nice, the European Union has established the necessary permanent bodies to define and have a common foreign and security policy: a Political and Security Committee, a military committee and a more European state.
</seg>
<seg id=1558>
For this cooperation, for their support and also for your welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency them thanks.
</seg>
<seg id=1559>
In these areas, in fact, the conference has failed due to the intransigence of certain Member States in this respect, I am deeply disappointed not only for the consequences in the short term, but by the spirit of deadlock, closure, incomprehension that conclusions can we draw from this position.
</seg>
<seg id=1560>
We must pay tribute to the Belgian Prime Minister Mr Guy Verhofstadt has fought to fund for the sake of a fairer presence of the candidate countries and to make less unreasonable, despite the fact that is still too high, the threshold of qualified majority voting in this way, Belgium has confirmed the great historic role in the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1561>
We now need to examine carefully the text in Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1562>
I would point out, by the way, Mr President of the European Council, the taxpayers' expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=1563>
And I see it as a failure not only in relation to the European Union proclaimed the ambition to change the institutions to be able to welcome new members correctly by improving the effectiveness of the European Union, but also a failure in relation to other important objective, which has perhaps been mentioned very little, bringing the European Union and the citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=1564>
The good questions, in our opinion, are the who asked the impressive human tide, from the whole of Europe, has converged in Nice on the eve of the summit.
</seg>
<seg id=1565>
Firstly, the Fifteen have signed hastily and teargas the Charter of fundamental rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1566>
(Applause)
</seg>
<seg id=1567>
My Group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned about the future and one in which we can all take, so we shall oppose it with all our strength.
</seg>
<seg id=1568>
Mr President, you have the floor.
</seg>
<seg id=1569>
Finally, I would say to Mr Hager that the instrument of closer cooperation is, in my opinion, a useful tool to enable Europe to have a dynamic and deliver the way, as I said a short while ago, I believe, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1570>
Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament on the summer time is a new conquest of Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1571>
It demoralised so far by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories perhaps find the will expressed both by the Member States and by this House, the value of developing the market of medicinal products for paediatric use, even if it does not have the size enough to allow the return on investment!
</seg>
<seg id=1572>
Is it necessary to bring the summer-time change, which was set during the oil crisis, in order to save energy, and that was extended until 2001?
</seg>
<seg id=1573>
The victims in a due process criminal is not always the protection of the situation.
</seg>
<seg id=1574>
Consequently, many passengers and tourists will benefit from this European initiative.
</seg>
<seg id=1575>
Mr President, only intervene to welcome the President of the Commission, who is here, and the Presidency of the Council is gathering pace, and to emphasise that probably never has been expressed in this Parliament unanimity like this on the results of a summit.
</seg>
<seg id=1576>
That works is that, in six months, under the leadership of the French Presidency, has now been completed, I believe, in spite of everything, its work on six key chapters.
</seg>
<seg id=1577>
However, my greatest fear is that Britain, France and Germany can now subvert the delicate balance created between Member States of different sizes and between the institutions over several decades.
</seg>
<seg id=1578>
It is difficult to understand how the Nice decisions could facilitate the enlargement of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=1579>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today I can be very brief.
</seg>
<seg id=1580>
For all of these reasons, I can only draw the consequence of that, when we vote on the Treaty of Nice, I am going to vote no.
</seg>
<seg id=1581>
Mr President, the most important result of Nice was, in spite of everything, which was signed a treaty, so that it is now possible to accommodate the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1582>
The real winners of this are Blair conference and Mr Aznar, Mr "no" of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1583>
Then, forget Nice, look at what is, I paid my hope with the draft convention put forward by Belgium for your Presidency, because it is shown, there is a clean sheet, there needs to be a change of method, we must speed up the history: 2004 it is too late, is too far, it is too dangerous.
</seg>
<seg id=1584>
Instead, the spirit of Nice has been in question arises as to how we can block, how can we intergubernamentalizar, how you can praise one at home as a defender of national interests instead of work for the European Union to move forward.
</seg>
<seg id=1585>
After Amsterdam and Nice we are a Europe of princes, a Europe of national administrations and not the Europe of the political unification.
</seg>
<seg id=1586>
We cannot continue to tackle the lack of qualified majority decisions in the essential issues.
</seg>
<seg id=1587>
It is true - parafrasearé Mr Bayrou - which have this seat since this morning; at the beginning, with the President of the Republic, and later, on a personal level, and llueven criticism, which, in my view, are moderate, friendly, but which, however, have yet to be criticism.
</seg>
<seg id=1588>
In fact, we must not forget that this is the first time since 1957 that reform, which is the model.
</seg>
<seg id=1589>
We are in constitutional systems, and the powers cannot be confused.
</seg>
<seg id=1590>
Thank you very much, Mr Minister.
</seg>
<seg id=1591>
But nor has it been incorporated into the Treaties and there has been a reference to the Charter in Article 2 (6) of the Treaty on European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1592>
Finally, there are some positive aspects: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty; the article concerning the political parties and their status; the right of this Parliament to demand to the other institutions before the Court of Justice: this is also an important factor of political control; the new formula for the European Commission, to include the so-called "Prodi lex" in the Treaty, to strengthen the President and the new composition of the Commission: reasonable compromise that I accept and work with the time; and, as my colleague Mr Tsatsos has pointed out, is the way forward in the future.
</seg>
<seg id=1593>
Mr President, we have already made a rigorous evaluation of what has happened in Nice, but it should be remembered that the Nice Summit began with a very limited agenda.
</seg>
<seg id=1594>
Look at the things: has not been included in the work of the charter treaty, not even a comment.
</seg>
<seg id=1595>
We want to demonstrate to the Heads of Government that we know best.
</seg>
<seg id=1596>
Despite the been negligent that the French Government has given this morning, the IGC frankly, has not yet been completed.
</seg>
<seg id=1597>
Mr President, it is not easy to criticise the French presidency during this debate, because it is not present. I understand that the President Chirac, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1598>
Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference has been outdated.
</seg>
<seg id=1599>
2001 budget (Continuation)
</seg>
<seg id=1600>
This does not mean, however, that is not something could be done more and better, and I would like divide the two areas.
</seg>
<seg id=1601>
This maximum obliges the Commission to set priorities within a limited budget, as must do all administration.
</seg>
<seg id=1602>
With the vote which will follow in this debate ends the long and complex process discharge of the budget of the European Union for 2001.
</seg>
<seg id=1603>
That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by making use of Article 272; there have been the financial perspectives, despite having used the flexibility instrument.
</seg>
<seg id=1604>
Let me just say to the Council that, with regard to this party, we have not been without footballs and this team intends to continue playing until we get the right result.
</seg>
<seg id=1605>
We do not want in the Colom resolution is already a review proposal for next year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share your criticism that this way of solving the financial inadequacy in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the Union' s external major objectives and the actual definition of the financial perspective.
</seg>
<seg id=1606>
To make this possible, we will have to set priorities.
</seg>
<seg id=1607>
This is the only way will correct and properly the money that our fellow citizens are at our disposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1608>
If we estimate the supplementary budget expected then it will be almost 8% while in all the other areas - whether the training policy, internal policy, including research, foreign policy, administration, pre-accession aid - experience in total only a growth rate of 1.1%.
</seg>
<seg id=1609>
And the cooperation is very positive, in the next supplementary budget, in January, we will have the opportunity to proseguirla.
</seg>
<seg id=1610>
We are also in favour of criticise yet unregulated relations between Russia and the Baltic States.
</seg>
<seg id=1611>
We are following with great interest to the development of society and the Russian domestic policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1612>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia represents the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1613>
Even if President Putin ensure the democratic development of his country, he is not automatically a guarantor of a stable and democratic Russia. the democratic order is not yet a reality experienced in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id=1614>
We must not let ourselves be insidious for our part, but that we must build the Europe of economic cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id=1615>
With regard to the Caucasus, Mr Van Orden is absolutely right.
</seg>
<seg id=1616>
Who observe Russia from outside and to be isolated impressions of the country and Russian partners is in danger of declare selectively this as the reality of the country which fits in its image of Russia.
</seg>
<seg id=1617>
In the political field, the common strategy for Russia intend to enter a permanent dialogue on political and security and create a permanent mechanism for this.
</seg>
<seg id=1618>
I would like to stress the seriousness that Russia is a political union with Belarus.
</seg>
<seg id=1619>
Do you intend to support this project, Commissioner Patten?
</seg>
<seg id=1620>
In this respect, in the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi, as Parliament will know, launched a far-reaching dialogue on energy.
</seg>
<seg id=1621>
I am very hopeful personally to visit Kaliningrad in the first part of next year and not just because Immanuel Kant happened throughout their lives in that city.
</seg>
<seg id=1622>
I congratulate the honourable Member once again on his excellent report on a very important issue in the next few years we shall refer again and again, I am sure, in this Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1623>
You puts me in a very difficult position.
</seg>
<seg id=1624>
Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very necessary because the BSE crisis has an enormous impact on feedingstuffs, on the cultivation and import of animal feed.
</seg>
<seg id=1625>
The Council has expressed its concern in many meetings with Russia, at all levels, in particular to make it think again to excessive use of force and avoid a possible extension of the conflict, to take independent and effective research on violations of human rights, to support the OSCE assistance group in carrying out its duty and, finally, to ensure the transport of humanitarian aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1626>
Mr President, on a point of order, it is usual in this House that the questions that cannot be respond orally sufficiently respond later in writing.
</seg>
<seg id=1627>
(Interruption from Mr Posselt)
</seg>
<seg id=1628>
This directive is 1992.
</seg>
<seg id=1629>
In this respect work must be done.
</seg>
<seg id=1630>
These groups are obviously left outside this new proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1631>
- (FR) the presidency and several Member States have already received correspondence the European sugar manufacturers concerning the Commission' s proposal, which will take into account in its deliberations.
</seg>
<seg id=1632>
Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):
</seg>
<seg id=1633>
Firstly, I have to say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet replied to the question by Mr Korakas.
</seg>
<seg id=1634>
Now, the Authority must be established and I believe that the European authorities are very concienciadas and that we will have to move forward.
</seg>
<seg id=1635>
More specifically, has met the representative of the presidency, in this case France ambassador in Algeria, with Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1636>
We welcome the proposed provisions in this respect by the preparatory Committee and decided by the General Assembly on the accreditation of non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and the special session in September 2001.
</seg>
<seg id=1637>
The cooperation includes a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1638>
As the Council emphasised to the honourable Member in her earlier reply, the process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters will enable better protect the rights of the people.
</seg>
<seg id=1639>
I would like to push him a little more.
</seg>
<seg id=1640>
In particular, guarantees the political control and the strategic direction of a military operation of crisis management.
</seg>
<seg id=1641>
I should simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty establishing a difference in treatment between the rates and the indirect taxes, in which harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - Article 93 - and the approximation, provided for in Article 94 of the legislation that impact directly on the establishment and operation of the common market, including those relating to direct taxation.
</seg>
<seg id=1642>
We see these three sectors in short.
</seg>
<seg id=1643>
If there is still a model of behaviour that in cases of doubt all fighting all this could break up the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe which is based on regional cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id=1644>
Ultimately, we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia, in addition a cooperation on both sides.
</seg>
<seg id=1645>
Mr President, our group supports the work carried out by Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the viability of the stabilisation and association negotiations with the Republic of Croatia.
</seg>
<seg id=1646>
Mr President, over the years in which I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to support many Croats in its efforts towards freedom and prosperity which they, like other peoples of our continent, identifying with their integration into the European institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=1647>
On the basis of the results achieved by Croatia this year, I have to say that I am confident we will be able to achieve a rapid pace.
</seg>
<seg id=1648>
This is, of course, in our opinion, and the speed with which we have brought our policy towards Croatia in the last few months confirms that.
</seg>
<seg id=1649>
We have a duty to Croatia to give his government and its people all kinds of aid in the coming years and we very much appreciate your wise advice to ensure that we continue to this path.
</seg>
<seg id=1650>
It is incomprehensible that the Laskar Jihad had the opportunity to go to the Moluccas this spring with thousands of supporters to exacerbate the conflict again.
</seg>
<seg id=1651>
In Timor, the militias blocking the return of refugees and the people who provide aid are asediadas.
</seg>
<seg id=1652>
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, I will confine myself to three points.
</seg>
<seg id=1653>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on the excellent work she has done.
</seg>
<seg id=1654>
It is not the only country in which this is happening.
</seg>
<seg id=1655>
The persistent violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh in Irian Jaya causes a great deal of pain to the population.
</seg>
<seg id=1656>
Tomorrow, we welcome here the ceremony of the award of the Sakharov Prize.

According to the most recent news arrivals of the Indonesian archipelago there is an urgent need, the question of whether the situation does not yet appear to be more serious, yes, more precarious, for the President Wahid and serves the rapporteur analyses enemies.
</seg>
<seg id=1658>
If we want to help Indonesia, we must now act with money and facts and not just words.
</seg>
<seg id=1659>
I believe that the report is extremely valuable to shed light on what has been happening.
</seg>
<seg id=1660>
It is clear that the difficulties in Indonesia has not been resolved overnight.
</seg>
<seg id=1661>
Protection of the Communities' financial interests
</seg>
<seg id=1662>
We must finally remove the obstacles to its independent activity, especially in the recruitment of staff and in its structure.
</seg>
<seg id=1663>
That is why the Commission must finally fulfil through a process of internal reform your announcement that it is not going to tolerate fraud and that each one of them is going to be pursued consistently.
</seg>
<seg id=1664>
I believe that this must be exactly the consequence of Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1665>
We would like to see the Member States open up negotiations to have uniform legislation in criminal matters, however, we do not want to put our countries to a public prosecutor federal community.
</seg>
<seg id=1666>
I would also like to know why was delayed until yesterday, after the Danish referendum on the euro, the publication of the document from the Commission on this matter.
</seg>
<seg id=1667>
I have tabled an amendment to citen the names of these countries, because it is high time to do so and shame.
</seg>
<seg id=1668>
I am sure that OLAF has an interest in shape in a transparent manner the selection of the management tables.
</seg>
<seg id=1669>
However, in the European Parliament must be careful not to see the beam in our eye for being so focused to see motes in the alien: that of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1670>
We are trying to put out a fire and suffocate ourselves with the smoke.
</seg>
<seg id=1671>
And no one can understand, I do not.
</seg>
<seg id=1672>
With a view to achieving fully this in mind, I would like to highlight four questions which I consider to be fundamental in the work of the authority on budgetary control.
</seg>
<seg id=1673>
The Treaty is a problem for Parliament itself.
</seg>
<seg id=1674>
Commissioner, it is worrying that has to call explicitly the Commission' s attention to the respect for the rights of Members as guardian of the Treaties.
</seg>
<seg id=1675>
Relate to a number of guidelines for the action that the Committee on Budgetary control can continue to when find problems in different areas, including the recommending to the Committee on Budgets that freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations allocated to the items in question in the next budget; not authorise transfers of appropriations which involve the increase of the items affected for a certain period until they have completed internal investigations additional; to ask the President of the Commission to call for the resignation of any Commissioner affected by the serious problems that have been revealed: something like a Caesarian operation of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=1676>
The report demands that are made detailed inventories of operational activities, comprehensive controls of the budget lines and irregularities as well as an internal assessment of the results on the part of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1677>
Commissioner, the starting point for the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.
</seg>
<seg id=1678>
But it would be the result of this common position, unless there is a change, which, in the end, only have a level playing field on America but even within Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1679>
I do not know why should not be achieved in this case, as has been achieved for all the other directives, to achieve a final compromise.
</seg>
<seg id=1680>
It is a proposal which has had a long, and I fear that stormy, way to overcome some of the difficulties.
</seg>
<seg id=1681>
The first amendment relates to Article 4, which lays down what has to be the authority responsible for monitoring the supply.

In the United Kingdom the regulation of takeover bids through the voluntary code of practice administered by the group responsible for takeover bids has produced very good results: a good example here a pragmatic approach to an extremely complex issue in which legislation would be less appropriate.

But, more than that, the best is that we can bring forward the Lisbon agenda to create a competitive and dynamic European economy.
</seg>
<seg id=1685>
In the European Parliament what we have to do is to regulate a minimum way at European level the major areas that cause tensions in the procurement law, for example, presidency against shareholders, major shareholders against small or companies against capital market.

A number of the amendments proposed by Parliament still improve the text of the common position of the Council, as a result, their points focus attention on issues which could lead to difficulties in the interpretation and that there is an urgent need for a more rapid transformation of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1687>
At the end of the day, it is not proven in any way that the proposed definition of fair price is better than any other, because the different definitions used at this time when the Member States work all very well.

In addition, it recognises the artist a right of information to take news of their rights in a period of up to three years before the professional traders of cultural objects, what is reasonable, because they have to be accounting purchases and sales.
</seg>
<seg id=1690>
Consequently, we must address the Austrian legislator and not attack the European legislator that only creates positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.
</seg>
<seg id=1691>
In addition, in the issue we are dealing with, the need for a common position is all the more because only a common position will enable the European Union to influence at international level to defend the interests of the creators at world level.
</seg>
<seg id=1692>
I trust in the wisdom and vision of this House.
</seg>
<seg id=1693>
In Germany, for example, of the 7,000 artists who transferred their rights in 1998 only 274, in fact, obtained any money for that and 40% of the droit de suite was intended to cover the costs to charge the sum.
</seg>
<seg id=1694>
In short, there is no need for a harmonisation of this type in this sector.

A similar amendment had already been rejected at first reading.

This rather tight timetable and difficult spite have thought that the translations could continue.

A reduction in the universal services - the very essence of the postal service sector - up to 50 grammes would seriously undermine the capacity of the national postal servants to provide a universal service to a accessible to all tariff regardless of the place where resident.

I would remind my Conservative colleagues the mess in which ran into the United Kingdom when they tried to privatise the British postal service.

</seg>
<seg id=1706>
We cannot tolerate, Madam President, Commissioner, and we will not tolerate that there is such a situation.
</seg>
<seg id=1707>
For this reason, the European Commission has not proposed the total liberalisation of postal services in the second phase.

<seg id=1708>
This is something that I wish the other European countries.

Madam President, Commissioner, what has taught us the debate, or rather the controversy raised by Commissioner Bolkestein in their quest for a liberalisation of postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation rules defined by this directive? using progressive terms and value, such as modernisation, liberalisation, accompanying of technological development, is in a social regression of the quality of a country.
</seg>
<seg id=1714>
The planned protection of universal services by means of a compensation fund which would allow use private profits for public services cannot be permanent.
</seg>
<seg id=1715>
These limits and delays have contributed to a debate in which it is often confuse the instruments purposes.
</seg>
<seg id=1716>
Madam President, to deal with this issue is concerned, we are talking about economic and social cohesion.
</seg>
<seg id=1717>
Madam President, first of all, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber because, of course, has done a complicated and difficult work where it has had to try to strike a balance between positions and proposals points of departure and arrival completely different.
</seg>
<seg id=1718>
I am afraid that the effect will be that the current monopoly can further strengthen its position at the taxpayers' expense and to raise the standard for the new applicant.
</seg>
<seg id=1719>
I am also pleased to see that our Liberal friends of the continent are setting an example to the British Liberal.
</seg>
<seg id=1720>
I certainly accept that the concept of liberalisation per se has nothing wrong and that it can be beneficial for consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=1721>
Justified, as it is included in the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, rather than the completion of the internal market for the free movement of goods and services in an environment of competition.
</seg>
<seg id=1722>
The universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and what we are doing is designed to create the right conditions for improvement.

Special services are another very important areas in which must be promoted innovation and modernisation.

</seg>
<seg id=1725>
I am in favour of there are sound guarantees to protect the obligations of universal service.
</seg>
<seg id=1726>
That is why I cannot remain silent and will remain silent while the future of the sector is threatened by the inability to overcome the challenges properly marked us all in Lisbon.
</seg>
<seg id=1727>
Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.
</seg>
<seg id=1728>
However, I would like to remind you that this common organisation of the market is the main objective of the guarantee of access to the Community market for their products.
</seg>
<seg id=1729>
It is absolutely necessary to find, over and above the tariff preference of EUR 300, a means to enable them to effective access to the quota C and assess the impact of the system of subsequent way in these producers.
</seg>
<seg id=1730>
For example, we cannot fail to express our concern about the banana production in certain countries ACP producers in the small countries of the West Indies and in some countries of the West Africa have been traditional suppliers of the banana market with which we have commitments that we must not forget.
</seg>
<seg id=1731>
Therefore, I ask that this report is supported in its entirety by the Members of this House, as it was in the Committee on Agriculture and rural development.
</seg>
<seg id=1732>
While the United States first condemn the historical reference periods, and now defend their own historical reference periods.
</seg>
<seg id=1733>
Involved, particularly the powerful interests of the Americans, which are not direct growers of bananas, but who have invested capital American commercial enterprises.
</seg>
<seg id=1734>
It sometimes seems as if the Commission, in the proposals deregulation in the trade and agricultural production at international level, even further than the Cairns Group.
</seg>
<seg id=1735>
It is a pity that the Commission and the Council continue to exist in a solution that can seriously compromising this production, particularly after 2006.
</seg>
<seg id=1736>
The successive opinions of the WTO does not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.
</seg>
<seg id=1737>
Thus, the transitional period should be almost years, and never less than ten and compensatory aid must include the guarantee of the incomes of Community producers and the departure of the production of the outermost regions, which means that they should be included aid for the marketing entities bananas there produced.
</seg>
<seg id=1738>
I hope that today will listen to our arguments, because this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, even EUR 300, can prove to be rather pointless in the facts as ACP producers will be hot-rolled steel by the so-called "system in order" arrival.

</seg>
<seg id=1770>
These objectives, the main and the secondary, will be the litmus test with those who have to judge the specific proposals put forward by the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1771>
It is well known that a solution - installation in one country with the possibility of provide services throughout the Union - could make an avalanche in those countries with lower taxation.
</seg>
<seg id=1772>
In 1992 we achieved an agreement, then considered minimum harmonisation, according to which the normal rate of VAT could not be less than 15% and the Member States had the power to implement one or more rates not less than 5%, in this case with derogations laid down.
</seg>
<seg id=1773>
We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there are no distortions of the market and that this report on the results to the Council and Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1774>
In short, the aim of this proposal is correct, but the method is unreasonable and if we really want to promote the e-economy of Europe, sending out the right signal would be set a zero rate of VAT for our companies operating via the Internet, instead try to impose our other problems.
</seg>
<seg id=1775>
In order to be able to fulfil the requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will have to take all kinds of measures to restrict it.

The CDs are not so archaic and it would be necessary to impose a tax, while the programmes that are circulating on the Internet would be outside the imposition of a rate.
</seg>
<seg id=1780>
However, the solution proposed is designed to be technically unworkable and to put obstacles to the promotion of transactions on the Internet in the Union, at a time when all hope its expansion.
</seg>
<seg id=1781>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union are losing real teeth and collection capacity.

The taxation of kerosene can only be introducing, therefore, by an international consensus so as to ensure that there is equality of competition.
</seg>
<seg id=1787>
I particularly welcome the fact that the report strengthen one of the key arguments presented in my report on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, transport and tourism and which was put to the vote in this Parliament a few months ago, namely that given that certainly is politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should look for alternative tools to achieve the same effect, including a rate for emissions.
</seg>
<seg id=1788>
In fact, the industry provides 100% of its infrastructure costs through charges of air traffic control and airport, which in 1998 amounted to a total of USD 4,000 million, unlike other modes of transport, such as rail and road, which are still heavily subsidised.
</seg>
<seg id=1789>
The current situation is not in favour of it.
</seg>
<seg id=1790>
In this context it has to be said, unfortunately, that emissions from air traffic are a problem which, although in percentage terms is not too large, is increasing and, therefore, we should not desdeñarlo.
</seg>
<seg id=1791>
The plan will be detrimental to the development of small and medium-sized businesses, both inside and outside the Union, especially in view of the proposal to reduce the exemption threshold to the prohibitively low level of turnover of EUR 40,000 per year.

<seg id=1792>
If we are too greedy to deal with the issue before us, we will be putting at risk the future of the important electronic commerce in Europe.

The starting point for providers outside the Community supply to customers within the Community should only be registered in a place cannot bring about a shift in tax revenue between the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1794>
Bearing in mind that the debate in the Council still continues and the Commission' s desire to settle the issue of VAT properly and electronic commerce in the short term, I think that the best thing at the moment is not formally take Parliament' s amendments, but making them a reality as far as possible through the negotiations within the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1795>
For this reason, I cannot accept the proposed amendments.

To complete the development of the European ambitious programme e-Contenidos there is a need to simplify and consolidate from the point of view of safety procedures considered.
</seg>
<seg id=1831>
That is why the objective of the public support measures for the promotion of the content industry of the EU must also be the achievement of a high level of culture and the diversification of the same.
</seg>
<seg id=1832>
On the other hand, are communication networks, which need the content to fill constantly its virtual area, and consider obvious the subordination of the content, purchase, use without special attention to the rules of production.
</seg>
<seg id=1833>
Mr President, I very much welcome the programme to the European digital content and I would like to highlight two points.
</seg>
<seg id=1834>
That is why I support the amendments calling for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.
</seg>
<seg id=1835>
Firstly, on the social and cultural role of the digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasis on the social and cultural dimension of the digital content.
</seg>
<seg id=1836>
Assessment and management of environmental noise
</seg>
<seg id=1837>
In fact, I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and for that matter, also a part of the Liberal Group, have given to this amendment in particular to limit aircraft noise.
</seg>
<seg id=1838>
This year alone, six years later the dates mentioned above, and under strong pressure from the French Government, the Commission has presented a proposal for harmonised noise indicators.
</seg>
<seg id=1839>
This proposal is, in fact, quite moderate, bearing in mind that the Scandinavian countries already have more stringent regulations than what we are proposing for the year 2012.
</seg>
<seg id=1840>
Orly, Schiphol, Barcelona and other airports meet with strict measures.
</seg>
<seg id=1841>
Another important point that we are proposing to incorporate and that it will be essential in the context of the problem of the aircraft noise is the definition of additional noise indicators, in addition to which the rapporteur has pointed out.
</seg>
<seg id=1842>
As a result of the lack of common regulations in the European Union, we have seen situations glaring distortion of competition between airports and a lack of fairness between the citizens of the various Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1843>
That is why the amendments of my colleague, Bernd Lange seem to me to be very important.
</seg>
<seg id=1844>
Mr President, first of all, I must say that I welcome this report.
</seg>
<seg id=1845>
This was the aim of amendment No 36, even though I believe that the idea has not yet been developed in depth.
</seg>
<seg id=1846>
We should take a close look at this aspect and then take a combined approach in both areas, establishing limit values on the one hand to the various sources of noise emissions and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions.
</seg>
<seg id=1847>
We need more time and I regret that we have not had, although in general terms, I support the framework directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1848>
Once the Member States have given comparable information, the Commission will study the question of introducing Community limit values and other measures to reduce the number of people who are affected by noise, and will submit a report to the Council and Parliament.

The European Court of Justice and even bodies responsible for resolving conflicts in the WTO consider that sometimes the precautionary principle applies environmental or in the field of public health, and sometimes even against Europeans, as demonstrated by the outstanding issue of the cheese fresh milk.

Finally, if we want the application of the precautionary principle to be effective and credible, it is essential the participation of all interested parties, including the representatives of civil society, in political decision-making surrounding its implementation

<seg id=1867>
And, finally, public health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly economic.

An essential condition for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concern about the possible harmful effects provide a scientific basis.

Yesterday, in Lisbon, at first hand, an American, Professor George Carlo, whom the food and Drugs administration has entrusted in the last seven years a study on the effect of radiation on human health, showed that there is a risk that the use of mobile phones strengthen the emergence of brain tumours, Alzheimer' s disease and injuries in the skin.

Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complicated machine with a lot of functions which monitor and we control in order to be able to play and that this should not be obstructed.

Mr President, in the absence of other results, the negotiations that took place in Nice will be made clear the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.

<seg id=1897>
The tone of the joint resolution is too simplistic.

<seg id=1898>
The delay the publication of the written conclusions - which have not yet been officially available at the moment, four days later - demonstrates the difficulty of drafting clearly decisions taken in the confusion.

Finally, a reference to social policy, which France had supported in the presentation of your presidency, but that, in the end, was in a very little full hand, apart from the declarations of intent and the titles of documents very vague and clearly inadequate content to the existing problems and the enormous dissatisfaction, of which the demonstration of workers in Nice was also important expression.
</seg>
<seg id=1903>
In the really important issues such as taxation, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration, everything is as before.
</seg>
<seg id=1904>
What is striking in the debate on Nice is the impression at the end of that the Treaty does not have father or mother and child anyone: the French Presidency desdobló in apologise, instead of accepting the outcome of the IGC clearly and their reasons; the political groups which correspond to the governments of the Member States multiplicaron criticism.

<seg id=1905>
On the contrary, it reduces the influence of national democracies, by restricting the right of veto and that is more power to the European Parliament.

But this Parliament fought for this reduction in the resources for innovative policies be compensated for using the flexibility instrument set in a clause of the budget estimate.

We all have a part to play in this important area because, in the truly global market in which we are already, the new ideas, with adequate resources, and with a firm and realistic support - will that we can maintain our place in Europe at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and in communications technology in particular.
</seg>
<seg id=1910>
In the previous speech were harsh words against budgets, and that is that EUR 400 million is really the minimum funding, so in the second part of the exercise we must make use of the possibilities of additional funding which offers the flexibility instrument, as has been pointed out in the report.
</seg>
<seg id=1911>
In my opinion, this will automatically, and not as the report concludes, a reduction of European added value.

As we all know, unemployment in the European Union is concentrated in the economic and technologically least-developed territories, particularly in the Objective 1, which is why we need the innovative actions are not only a simple technological nature, but which are inspired by an explicit will of economic development and employment.

Mr President, I should like to start by Helmut Markov to thank and congratulate him on the extremely competent and serious constructive presentation of the draft communication on the ERDF innovative actions for the period 2000-2006.

Energy efficiency and the aspects of environmental policy in these guidelines have not been forgotten. may give rise to innovative actions by way of third issue, which concerns the regional identity and sustainable development.

<seg id=1916>
However, we hope that the projects are selected at regional level, as indeed Mr Berend has understood correctly in his speech.
</seg>
<seg id=1917>
The debate is closed.

<seg id=1918>
That is why we are asking for in this report and in the three amendments that we have added to the Commission to redouble its efforts to bring proceedings before the WTO conciliation.

I believe that the Commissioner has to prove to the industry is doing everything we can in this respect to deal with this external threat to our industry.

Finally, of course, we hope that, since 18 December, be examined at the meeting of the 6 OECD agreement group "ships" .

As you all know, the simple handling this procedure will need more than six months.

For the large corporations, and its political lawyers, claim less State means that the state and its finances must be exclusive at its disposal.

I also believe that it would be appropriate to take the submarine Tireless in Britain to repair, as soon as possible, as soon as appropriate climatic conditions.

You have asked whether the Commission considers that directive 89/618/Euratom on information to the population in the event of a radiological emergency, and Directive 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards are for the implementation of the submarine and what measures have been taken accordingly.
</seg>
<seg id=1933>
In accordance with the normal procedure for complaints, we cannot make public this answer, although we can say in broad outline what he says.
</seg>
<seg id=1934>
One aspect of the Euratom Treaty is the transport of radioactive waste between Member States, but, of course, Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and contaminated waste will be a part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without passing through any Member State of the European Union.

The lack of spending in new military equipment due to the cuts in the area of defence of the British Labour government will lead in the future, without doubt, more frequent episodes of military equipment defective withdrawn to make essential repairs.

The competence of the Community, even though some people wish to something else, does not cover the classification of ports to make repair work in submarines, or technical safety issues of nuclear reactors and the requirements for a submarine may be withdrawn to repair elsewhere.

We should, in order to give them even more aid, to ask the Community institutions to strengthen the human and financial resources materials of the UNHCR had.

<seg id=1975>
The promotion of training throughout life - something that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is another issue which I also support.

Of course, the people of more than 60 or 70 years can still do many things useful, but it is a mistake to make their age, their income dependent on his work.

It is not a question of double operations advertising or promotion of each sector or operators of public authorities.

<seg id=1989>
Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, in principle, was also in favour of the Commission' s proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1990>
That is why it is very important to offer compensation and it can establish very properly through advertising and promotion measures.
